     - "response_types_supported": [  "code",  "token",  "id_token",  "code token",  "code id_token",  "token id_token",  
       "code token id_token",  "none" ]

     - "id_token_alg_values_supported": [  "RS256" ]
     - "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": [  "client_secret_post" ]

Main:
  - A given user ("Resource Owner") allows an application "B" ("Resource Server") to allow any Application "A" ("client") to do
    something on its behalf
  - Scenarios (this doc only shows [C] and [S]:
     - [C]: client-side
     - [S]: server-side. Use a CLIENT_SECRET so only specific app can do requests.
     - [A]: desktop/mobile apps. Similar to [S] except for APP_URL. CLIENT_SECRET is in the app, so can't be treated as secret.
     - [D]: other devices (game console, printer, etc.). Since user consent cannot happen on the device, user gets a key that
            needs to be entered in a web browser using another device.
  - Initial data:
     - Elements:
        - CLIENT_ID
        - [S] CLIENT_SECRET (shared secret between "A" and "B")
        - APP_URL_ARR (only https://)
     - With Google: 
        - registration with Google App Console.
        - also contains:
           - some content shown on user consent window (name, logo, main page URL)
           - API_KEY (same function as CLIENT_ID)
  
Scenario ( __ means POST variables):
  - Getting TOKEN [S]:
     - "A". GET  - AUTH_URL?       TOKEN_REQUEST
     - "B". GET  - APP_URL?        AUTHORIZATION_CODE
     - "A". POST - AUTH_URL__      INTERMEDIARY_TOKEN_REQUEST  -> ACCESS_TOKEN
  - Getting TOKEN [C]:
     - "A". GET  - AUTH_URL?       TOKEN_REQUEST
     - "B". GET  - APP_URL#        ACCESS_TOKEN
  - Using TOKEN (authorized access):
     - "A". *    - *               Authorization: Bearer TOKEN
                   *__|?           access_token=TOKEN
  - Checking TOKEN is valid and not expired:
      - use PUBLICKEY of ISSUER on TOKEN 
      - for Google, with authorized access can (but is slow), prefer checking (see GOOGLEAPIS verifyToken())
         - "A". GET  - TOKEN_INFO_URL                         -> TOKENINFO (400 if not valid)
  - Getting new TOKEN [S]:
     - "A". POST - TOKEN_URL__     REFRESH_REQUEST            -> ACCESS_TOKEN (without user consent or refresh_token field)
  - Revoking a TOKEN [S]:
     - "A". GET  - REVOKE_URL?     token=REFRESH_TOKEN        -> response code 200 if ok, 400 if not

     
Parameters:
  - TOKEN_REQUEST:
     - response_type STR: "token" [C], "code" [S]
     - client_id CLIENT_ID
     - redirect_uri APP_URL, percent-encoded
     - scope STR, e.g. "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/SERVICE ...". 
       It is good to only ask for the scope when action needed, not for all possible needed.
     - state STR: a value that is passed as is to APP_URL, percent-encoded. Example usage: keeping original URL around.
       Can be used as CSRF token too.
  - TOKEN_REQUEST (Google-specific):
     - api_key API_KEY
     - include_granted_scopes BOOL: include previously granted scopes. 
       Goal: if several requests with different scopes, instead of having several TOKEN_STR with different scopes, 
       the final TOKEN_STR has all the scopes, and others can be dropped.
     - immediate BOOL: if true, no popup. Only for refresh ???
     - [S] access_type "online|offline": if "offline", ACCESS_TOKEN will get a refresh_token
     - approval_prompt "force|auto": if "force", prompt again even if permission already given for current scope
     - login_hint STR: pre-fill the email/username field. Must be either the sub USER_ID or the user email address.
       Can also be "sub", "email" or "address"??? (or several???)
     - prompt "none|consent [select_account]": "none" doesn't show user consent and fails if not logged in. 
       "consent" ask for user content and to log in. "select_account" let user pick account.
  - AUTHORIZATION_CODE:
     - error STR: only if fail
     - state STR
     - code CODE_STR: only if success
  - INTERMEDIARY_TOKEN_REQUEST:
     - code CODE_STR
     - client_id CLIENT_ID
     - client_secret CLIENT_SECRET
     - redirect_uri APP_URI
     - grant_type "authorization_code"
  - ACCESS_TOKEN:
     - access_token TOKEN_STR: JWT, signed by ISSUER private key
     - [S] refresh_token REFRESH_TOKEN: only if access_type "offline". 
     - expires_in STR: in seconds
     - [S???] token_type "Bearer"
     - state STR
  - TOKEN_INFO:
     - error STR: only if expired
     - expires_in STR
     - scope STR
     - audience CLIENT_ID (Google specific???)
  - REFRESH_REQUEST:
     - client_id CLIENT_ID
     - client_secret CLIENT_SECRET
     - grant_type "refresh_token"
     - refresh_token REFRESH_TOKEN


Authentication:
  - Like [S] but:
     - Use scope "openid[ email]": if email, email[_verified] fields will be present in id_token OBJ.
     - Use state STR, where STR is GET variables percent encoded:
        - security_token STR: CSRF token. Must verify that state STR remains unchanged across the exchange.
        - Any other, e.g. former url STR
  - ACCESS_TOKEN has id_token OBJ:
     - iss ISSUER
     - at_hash STR: not necessary
     - sub STR: user ID
     - email STR: a single user ID can have alias emails
     - email_verified BOOL
     - aud CLIENT_ID
     - azp CLIENT_ID
     - iat NUM: when request was made
     - exp NUM: when it expires
  - Must always verify that id_token.iss|aud are good
  - Access to Google+ profile:
     - if scope: "profile", TOKENINFO.userid STR is there
     - GET - https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/USERID/openIdConnect -> OBJ:
        - kind: "plus#personOpenIdConnect"
        - gender: "male|female|other"
        - sub: user ID
        - [given|family_]name STR
        - profile URL (Google+ page)
        - picture URL
        - email STR
        - email_verified BOOL
        - locale STR: user preferred locale
     - USERID: "me" to use authenticated user (require access authorization with scope: "profile"):
        - https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me/openIdConnect = DiscoveryDocument.userinfo_endpoint
