                                  #Pluralize|singularize English words, including irregular ones


PLURALIZ.singular|plural(STR)->STR#Returns STR in singular|plural form
                                  #Case:
                                  #  - case-insensitive (using STR.toLowerCase(), i.e. not i18n-ready)
                                  #  - for irregular words, might return lowercase, unless input is uppercase or Titleized
                                  #    (only first char upper), in which case keep that case
PLURALIZE(STR[, NUM][, BOOL])->STR#Returns PLURALIZE.singular|plural(STR), according to NUM (def: plural)
                                  #Also: if true, prepends "NUM "
