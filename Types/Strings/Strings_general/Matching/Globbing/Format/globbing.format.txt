SPECIFICATION ==>                 #None
                                 ##Notation meaning usually implementation-specific

ESCAPING ==>                     ##Usually \ "" ''

CASE-SENSITIVITY ==>             ##Usually enabled

FILE EXPANSION ==>                #Whether globbing matches:
                                  #  - a string
                                  #  - a list of file paths
                                 ##     - / and|or \ is path delimiter (usually only /)
                                 ##     - not only regular files are usually matched
                                  #  - a list of file paths of existing files
                                  #     - using current directory
                                 ##     - symlinks are usually not followed

NULLGLOB ==>                     ##Whether non-matching globbing is:
                                 ##  - interpreted as not globbing, i.e. kept as is
                                 ##  - evaluating to an empty string

*                                 #Expand to any characters, including none
                                  #If file expansion:
                                  #  - make it match filenames instead
                                  #  - stop at /
                                 ##  - /*/ must match at least once character
                                 ##  - first character cannot be . (unless "dotglob")
**                                #Globstar. Only with file expansion.
                                  #Like * but:
                                  #  - does not stop at /
                                  #  - must be before|after / or nothing
                                  #I.e. match file paths, not filenames

?                                 #1 character, any

[CHAR...]                         #1 character, among those
[!CHAR...]
[^CHAR...]                        #1 character, excluding those
[...[:CLASS:]...]                 #Character among POSIX class (see its doc)
[...CHAR-CHAR2...]                #ASCII character between two, in ASCII order

{...,...}                         #Same as @(...|...)

EXTENDED GLOBBING ==>             #All of the following
@(...|...)                        #Matches any pattern 1 time
!(...|...)                        #Anything not matching this pattern 1 time
?(...|...)                        #Matches any pattern 0|1 times
*(...|...)                        #Matches any pattern 0|n times
+(...|...)                        #Matches any pattern 1|n times
