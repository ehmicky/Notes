VERSION ==>                       #4.2.10

GRACEFUL-FS                       #Fixes some behavior of core FS error handling.
                                  #Ponyfill of FS where:
                                  #  - handles EMFILE|ENFILE (too many open files):
                                  #     - only for FS.readFile|writeFile|appendFile|reeaddir() and FS|STREAM.open()
                                  #     - queue the call instead of error: wait for FS.close() then retry
                                  #  - add FS.lutimes[Sync]()
                                  #  - ignore following errors for FS.*chown|chmod*():
                                  #     - ENOSYS: filesystem does not support chown
                                  #     - EINVAL: file that can never be chowned, e.g. NFS mount
                                  #     - EPERM: user is not root
                                  #  - make FS.rename() retry on EACCES|EPERM for up to one minute, on Windows:
                                  #     - reason: some anti-virus software lock directories while running
                                  #  - make FS.read[Sync]() retry on EAGAIN up to 10 times:
                                  #     - EAGAIN means file temporary unavailable, but will be back up
                                  #  - caches process.cwd()
                                  #     - patches process.chdir() to invalidate that cache
