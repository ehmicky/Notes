VERSION ==>                   #Version: 3.0 beta8

PACKAGES ==>                  #  - redis-server: redis-server, redis-sentinel
                              #  - redis-tools: redis-cli, redis-benchmark, redis-check-dump|aof

SHORT SUMMARY ==>             #Use case:
                              #  - key-value store
                              #  - eleviates application logic with:
                              #     - structured data types: strings, int, floats, binary, objects, list/array, sets, zsets (sets with weights), hyperloglog (sets for counting unique elements)
                              #     - algorithms: sorting
                              #  - pubsub system
                              #  - good use as a cache:
                              #     - "maxmemory": limiting memory (e.g. LRU)
                              #     - expiration on keys
                              #Main properties:
                              #  - optimized for speed
                              #     - performance: cursors
                              #  - poor security on its own (by design)
                              #Other properties:
                              #  - ACID:
                              #     - atomicity/consistency/isolation:
                              #        - strong because single-threaded, every operation atomic
                              #        - can use transactions
                              #     - durability:
                              #        - RDB: compressed snapshot/backups saved on demand or automatically on change
                              #        - AOF:
                              #           - log incoming commands, to reduce crash problems
                              #           - can control how durability/caching tradeoff (i.e. flushing to disk)
                              #  - Scaling:
                              #     - replication: read-only slaves
                              #     - clusters: distribute data accross several read-write servers (using modulo of hash(KEY))
                              #  - High availability: sentinels: monitor for failover to replicated slaves. Can handle partitions.
                              #  - Monitoring: logging, debug info, performance (latency, slow operations)
                              #  - connection control (e.g. max clients)
                              #  - simple text-based protocol
                              #  - limits: 4 billions keys, objects with 4 billions elements

HOW TO USE LESS SPACE/MEMORY  #  - use 32 bits CPU (but memory will be limited to 4GB)
  ==>                         #  - using BITSTR
                              #  - uses OBJ instead of namespaced STR

TIPS ==>                      #  - Use pipelining
                              #  - when writing big chunks, should use protocol: write commands in a .txt file, and send it
                              #    with ncap or (better) with redis-cli --pipe (will parse "inline version" of the protocol)
                              #  - most important factors: latency&bandwith > CPU > Mem speed
                              #  - Unix sockets faster that loopback
                              #  - Single threaded, so must launch 1 redis-server per CPU core (see Redis Cluster)
                              #  - put log files, RDB and AOF on same device
                              #  - don't use monitor in production, but info is fine
                              #  - CONFVAR hz (def: 10): raising will increase CPU usage but lower latency
