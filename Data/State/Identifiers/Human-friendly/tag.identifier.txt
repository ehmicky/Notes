STANDARDS ==>                     #RFC 4151

GOAL ==>                          #URI scheme describing identity and metadata:
                                  #  - not meant to describe a location (i.e. no resolution)
                                  #  - decentralized
                                  #  - human-friendly
                                  #Similar to UUID goals, but using human-friendly format instead of random numbers.

FORMAT ==>                        #tag:DOMAIN|EMAIL,DATE:TAG[#HASH]
                                  #  - DOMAIN|EMAIL:
                                  #     - case-sensitive, lowercase prefered
                                  #     - must own it
                                  #  - DATE:
                                  #     - YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
                                  #     - UTC
                                  #     - ctime
                                  #  - TAG:
                                  #     - same charset as HASH
                                  #     - human friendly title/description
                                  #     - application should enforce uniqueness
                                  #Should avoid percent-encoding to make it human-friendly
                                  #Normalization: none (compare byte-wise)
