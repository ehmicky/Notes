COMPARISON ==>                    #Table-like:
                                  #  - based on CSV:
                                  #     - CSV (prefered): standard, widely used, simplistic
                                  #     - TSV: tab delimiter
                                  #     - DSV: any delimiter
                                  #  - Excel: featureful (e.g. formatting), proprietary
                                  #Tree:
                                  #  - simplistic:
                                  #     - INI: simplistic, but very few features and not standardized
                                  #     - TOML (prefered): simple and human-friendly, not fit for complex data
                                  #  - based on JSON:
                                  #     - JSON (prefered): standard, widely used, simple, fast
                                  #     - HJSON (prefered): adds comments, unquoted VAR|STR, no|trailing commas,
                                  #       multiline string, NaN|Inf, DATE, custom types
                                  #       Compared with JSON5:
                                  #        - more featureful, better quality, different programming languages
                                  #        - less JavaScript-looking, slower, less maintained, less high-profile
                                  #     - JSON5: adds ES5 syntax, i.e. comments, unquoted VAR, trailing commas,
                                  #       multiline string, NaN|Inf
                                  #     - CSON (avoid): adds CoffeeScript syntax, i.e. indentation, comments, unquoted VAR,
                                  #       no commas, multiline string
                                  #     - ESON (not maintained): interesting concept of pluggable special types for
                                  #       human-friendly types (time, dimensions, includes, ENVVAR|args)
                                  #  - featureful:
                                  #     - YAML (prefered): featureful, human-friendly, many types, references
                                  #     - XML: very featureful for query|transformation, strongly typed, very complex

PERFORMANCE ==>                   #This is based on the currently documented implementations, and in a JavaScript environment
                                  #Fast:
                                  #  - JSON:
                                  #     - fastest, used as unit here
                                  #     - 1ms to parse|stringify small file
                                  #  - XML: around same as JSON, although JSON much faster in JavaScript environment
                                  #Normal:
                                  #  - JSON5:
                                  #     - 4 time slower on parse|stringify
                                  #     - slower when parsing big files
                                  #  - YAML: 4-6 times slower on parse, 10-15 times on stringify, depending on schema used
                                  #  - HJSON:
                                  #     - 8 time slower on parse|stringify
                                  #     - slower at serializing small files
                                  #  - INI: 8 time slower on parse|stringify
                                  #Slow:
                                  #  - TOML: 100 times slower on parse|stringify
                                  #  - CSON: 500 times slower on parse, 6 on stringify
