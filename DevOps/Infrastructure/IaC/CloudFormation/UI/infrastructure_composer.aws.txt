Edit TEMPLATE YAML|JSON via widget canvas

Add|remove RESOURCEs via drag&drop

Can link RESOURCEs via drag&drop
  - If not available, connections (e.g. { Ref }) must be done in TEMPLATE directly
     - They are then shown in UI

Edit RESPROPs via double-click on RESOURCE

Import|export TEMPLATE

Save as PNG

Enhanced component:
  - like CDK L2 component, but for Infrastructure Composer
  - better experience for editing RESPROPs, but fewer of them
  - only for some RESOURCEs with some SERVICEs
  - documented in each SERVICE

LOCAL SYNC ==>                    #Sync local TEMPLATE with browser
                                  #Browser must have File System Access API (e.g. not Firefox as of now)

TEMPLATE.Metadata                 #COMPOSER_GROUPS. Groups organizing RESOURCEs
 ['AWS::Composer::Groups']        #Only visual
COMPOSER_GROUPS.Group.Label       #'COMPOSER_GROUP'
COMPOSER_GROUPS.Group.Members     #'RESOURCE|COMPOSER_GROUP'_ARR

TEMPLATE.Metadata['AWS::Composer  #EXTERNAL_RESOURCE
 ::ExternalResources'].RESOURCE   #RESOURCE provisioned outside of CloudFormation
                                  #I.e. only meant to be used as { Ref }
                                  #Currently only with enhanced component "RDS Database (external)"
                                  #Also creates some TEMPLATE.Parameters for the RESOURCE's identifiers

SAM ==>                           #The enhanced component for API Gateway and Lambda use:
                                  #  - RESTYPE 'AWS::Serverless:*'
                                  #  - TEMPLATE.Transform 'AWS::Serverless-*'
