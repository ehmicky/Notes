VERSION ==>                       #2024-11-04

ALTERNATIVES ==>                  #  - Infrastructure Composer (preferred)
                                  #  - CloudFormation Designer: deprecated alternative
                                  #  - cdk-builder (see CDK doc):
                                  #     - uses CDK
