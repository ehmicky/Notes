VERSION ==>                       #1.91.0

SAM CLI ==>                       #See its doc
                                  #Does not require SAM transform: supports regular RESTYPEs
                                  #However, does support SAM transform: AWS::Serverless::* RESTYPEs
                                  #Is not required by SAM transform: since transformation happens inside CloudFormation, not locally

TEMPLATE.Transform                #Must include 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
                                  #If has 'AWS::LanguageExtensions', must be after it
                                  #Transforms AWS::Serverless::* RESTYPEs into regular ones

TRANSFORMATION ==>                #Happens inside CloudFormation itself, not locally
                                  #I.e. any CloudFormation-related tool:
                                  #  - in order to support TEMPLATEs with SAM transform
                                  #  - must be enhanced to handle AWS::Serverless::* RESTYPEs and TEMPLATE.Globals

TEMPLATE.Globals.TYPE.RESPROPS    #OBJ. Default RESPROPs
                                  #Only for AWS::Serverless::TYPE???
                                  #OBJs are deeply merged, ARRs are prepended
                                  #Api also applies to AWS::Serverless::Function EventSource of Type 'Api'
                                  #Does not support following RESPROPs:
                                  #  - Function: FunctionName, Role, Policies, Events
                                  #  - [Http]Api: StageName, DefinitionBody
                                  #  - HttpApi: DefinitionUri
