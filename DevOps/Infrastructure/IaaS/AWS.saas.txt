REST API ==>                  #Difference from usual REST API:

                              #  - VAL_ARR is either:
                              #     - in non-XML (query variable), VAR.NUM. (starting with 1)
                              #     - in XML (request|response body), several VAR (<KEYSet|List><VAR></VAR>...</KEYSet|List>)

                              #  - Eventual consistency: should test existence first, with exponential retry delays up to a
