VERSION ==>                   #2014/07/30

GOAL ==>                      #Remote virtual machines.
                              #Concepts:
                              #  - Image/AMI: instance memory state including OS (like a Virtual machine image), e.g.
                              #    boot partition (usually /dev/sda1)
                              #  - Instance type: hardware configuration (CPU, memory, storage, network capacity)
                              #  - Instance: running image copy, with a specific instance type
                              #     - Dedicated instance: instance that run on a computer only dedicated to it (for security)
                              #     - PlacementGroup: for faster connection between related instances
                              #  - Volume: virtual hard drive.
                              #     - Can be persistent (EBS) or not (instance stores).
                              #     - Can do snapshots.
                              #     - Can import/export from Xen, Hyper-V or VMWare
                              #Networking:
                              #  - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): EC2 networking layer (also applied on ELB, RDS, EMR, etc.),
                              #    below in this doc
                              #  - Enhanced networking: higher packet per second, lower network latency
                              #Marketplace:
                              #  - can buy reserved instances AMIs from 1 month to 36 months (instead of normal AMIs)
                              #Connection:
                              #  - Automatically launch sshd, with ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with the created public keys
                              #  - Username depends on OS: ec2-user (Amazon Linux, Fedora Red Hat), root (Red Hat, Suse),
                              #    ubuntu, fedora. Can sudo without password
                              #  - Must connect to Public IP/DNS
                              #  - Must allow SSH (SecurityGroup)

INSTANCE TYPES ==>            #Differences:
                              #  - Price
                              #  - CPU, RAM, Storage, Network performance
                              #  - CPU:
                              #     - Power is calculated in ECU.
                              #     - vCPU is number of CPUs (ECU is vCPU-independent)
                              #     - Intel Xeon, with features:
                              #        - AVX: for floating point extensions
                              #        - Boost technology: faster CPU
                              #Instance size:
                              #  - Each type has sizes, which doubles memory, vCPU, ECU, instance storage, for about twice the
                              #    price: "micro", "small", "medium", "large", "[2|4|8]xlarge"
                              #      - EBS-optimized only on *xlarge
                              #      - instance storage sometimes double number of instance storage, sometimes double GB of
                              #        instance storages
                              #      - max total MB/s for all volumes depends on size, 30MB/s for large, doubles for every size
                              #      - max total MB/s for any single volume is 128MB/s
                              #Types
                              #  - Compare here pseudo-"large" instances, but types have different size ranges which might
                              #    not include "large"

                              #        - Burstable CPU: gets 48 CPU credits/hours (half for each lower size)
                              #        - 1 CPU credit == 3.5 ECU for one minute
                              #        - max 1150 credits (24 hours) (half for each lower size)

IP RANGES ==>                 #VPC: private IPs CIDR (mask 28 to 16).
                              #  - All network resources and instance-like are VPC-wise and cannot move between VPCs
                              #Subnet: subrange of private IPs CIDR inside a VPC, for specific RouteTable and AvailabilityZone
                              #  - First four and last one are "Amazon-reserved"
                              #NetworkInterface: sets of private IPs on an instance (and their associated public/elastic IPs)
                              #  - "secondary" (additional) privateIPs/NetworkInterfaces on same instance goals:
                              #     - can be attached|detached from the instance and moved to another instance ("remapping"),
                              #       carrying the associated public/elastic IPs with them
                              #        - prefer remapping NetworkInterfaces than only ElasticIP since it also keep Subnet and
                              #          Subnet-level resources (RouteTable, NetworkAcl, etc.).
                              #     - secondary private IPs: hosting several websites on same instance.
                              #     - secondary NetworkInterfaces:
                              #         - several Subnets (so RouteTable, NetworkAcl too) on same instance, e.g. one
                              #           communicating with the internet, and one communicating with the back-end
                              #         - must configure underlying OS (unless specified at RunInstances()-time).
                              #           Can use ec2-net-utils to do so.
                              #  - by def., 1 networkInterface eth0 with 1 primary private IP
                              #  - has a MAC address
                              #  - sourceDestCheck: if true (def), checks that networkInterface is original source of traffic
                              #    sent and final destination of traffic received. Disable it for proxies (e.g. NAT instances).

COMMUNICATION ==>             #Out-traffic uses RouteTable: subnet-level sets of routes, e.g. how to route ("target")
                              #according to "destination" IP (using a CIDR):
                              #  - target can be:
                              #     - "local": towards the same VPC (private IPs)
                              #     - InternetGateway: towards the internet (public IPs)
                              #     - VpnGateway:
                              #        - towards a private network using IPsec (VPN)
                              #        - targets a CustomerGateway
                              #        - EnableVgwPropagation: update RouteTable when creating|updating VpnGateway
                              #     - VpcPeeringConnection: towards another VPC (private IPs), one-way
                              #        - Can targets full CIDR of peered VPC, or only specific subnets
                              #        - CIDR must not overlap
                              #        - peered VPC must accept the request
                              #        - cannot resolve private DNS of peered VPC: must use private IPs instead
                              #     - Instance|NetworkInterface: sends to another Instance|NetworkInterface instead, usually a
                              #       proxy:
                              #        - NAT instance:
                              #           - proxy that interfaces private instances and the internet
                              #             Allows traffic out but not traffic in.
                              #           - Can find AMI configured to run as NAT instance with Name "amzn-ami-vpc-nat*"
                              #  - if two destination CIDR match, choose the one with highest mask
                              #  - there is always a default RouteTable (if none specified for a subnet), with only one
                              #    Route with "destination" VPC_CIDR and "target" "local"
                              #In-traffic:
                              #  - must have a public IP either:
                              #     - automatically assigned
                              #     - Elastic IP (don't work in VPN)
                              #  - often assigned on a LoadBalancer, then use private DNS hostnames to communicate inside the

                              #        - use DHCP, at each instance start|run or when an ElasticIP is disassociated
                              #        - associated to primary private IP of primary networkInterface
                              #     - with an ElasticIP (must request then associate it at each start|run), which allows
                              #       static IPs
                              #        - Can be remapped to another one (if instance fails)

DNS HOSTNAMES ==>             #  - public|private DNS hostnames automatically assigned (when IP is changed) if
                              #    EnableDnsHostnames true (VPC attributes) (def: true for default VPC, false for non-default)
                              #    DNS lookup works if EnableDnsSupport true (def: always true)
                              #  - Can modify DHCPOptions to use custom DNS server
                              #  - can use custom hostnames too

SECURITY ==>                  #Can control in|out traffic at:
                              #  - Instance-level (SecurityGroup)
                              #  - Subnet-level (NetworkAcl)

                              #     - one InternetGateway
                              #     - route 172.31.0.0/16 to "local" and 0.0.0.0/0 to InternetGateway
                              #     - VPC attributes: EnableDnsSupport and EnableDnsHostnames true
                              #  - "EC2-Classic" is previous version of EC2 (now it is "EC2-VPC"), available if old account
                              #    (before 2013). Different from default VPC.
                              #  - t2.* instances always use a non-default VPC
