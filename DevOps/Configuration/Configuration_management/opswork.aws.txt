OPSWORKS ==>                  #Version from 2013-12-05
                              #Global service, so must use REGION us-east-1

GOAL ==>                      #Apply Chef recipes on sets of AWS resources.
                              #How it works:
                              #  - stack, layer, AWS resources, apps fill in ATTR_JSON
                              #  - during events (automatic) or manually (deployment), recipes are executed that uses ATTR_JSON

LESS FLEXIBILITY ==>          #Using OpsWorks give a bit less flexibility:
                              #  - EC2 instances:
                              #     - less parameters than EC2 CreateInstance()
                              #     - CloudWatch metrics only available through AWS console
                              #  - AutoScalingGroup: less parameters, including for HealthChecks, and can only access through
                              #    OpsWorks

                                  ┌─────────────┐
                                  │   GENERAL   │
                                  └─────────────┘

STACK ==>                     #  - Sets of Layers with also:
                              #     - EC2 instances default launch configuration (main parameters)
                              #     - Chef configuration
                              #  - DescribeStackSummary(): can see number of instances according to launch state
                              #  - OpsWorks uses ServiceRoleArn, a ROLE to operate on AWS resource (different from instances
                              #    DefaultInstanceProfileArn).
                              #     - Def. allows ec2|elasticloadbalancing|rds:*, cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics, iam:PassRole

LAYER ==>                     #  - Set of similar EC2-related resources (e.g. fleet of Node.js servers) with common:
                              #     - Chef recipes
                              #     - default configuration (Elastic IP, SecurityGroup, instance profile, EBS Volumes)
                              #  - EC2-related resources:
                              #     - EC2, EBS, ELB, AutoScaling, RDS (VPC is stack-level)
                              #     - Usually ELB, EC2+EBS+AutoScaling, RDS would be in separate layers
                              #     - Can be in several layers (useful when hosting several functions on same machine)
                              #  - Often has one layer for each major branch, e.g. production, development, release candidates
                              #  - There are predefined layers, by using Type and Attributes (all EC2 instances except RDS):
                              #     - Web server: Java (Tomcat), Node.js, PHP, Rails, Static (Nginx)
                              #     - Database: RDS, MySQL, Memcached
                              #     - LoadBalancer: HAProxy
                              #     - Monitoring server: Ganglia

OPSWORKS-RELATED AWS          #  - Must be registered|attached with registering functions, meaning assigned to a stack or layer
RESOURCES ==>                 #     - modifications after registration will not be kept when resource is restarted unless an
                              #       Update*() function exists (case of all but LoadBalancer and AutoScalingGroup)
                              #  - Can create some with creator functions, same as using the relevant AWS service but:

                              #     - simpler (fewer options)
                              #  - Can use some helper functions: like creator functions (simpler than using AWS service

                              #           - creator functions Create|UpdateInstance(): since no registering functions, must use
                              #             creator function (which has less options that EC2 CreateInstance())
                              #           - helper functions Start|Stop|RebootInstance()
                              #           - Automatically sets up Hostname STR
                              #              - can also GetHostnameSuggestion(), which uses HostnameTheme (stack-level) to
