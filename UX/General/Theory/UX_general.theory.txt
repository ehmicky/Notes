STAKEHOLDERS ==>                  #Design for the true stakeholders:
                                  #  - i.e. the ones actually benefitting from the system
                                  #  - e.g. not clients but clients' clients

FINDING INFORMATION ==>           #Focus on what user seeks:
                                  #  - minimize unnecessary content and design
                                  #  - provide search function
