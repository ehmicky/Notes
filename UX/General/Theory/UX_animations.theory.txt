PURPOSE ==>                       #On any user interaction:
                                  #  - visual feedback
                                  #  - to smooth UI changes (e.g. view transitions)

NOT OBSTRUCTIVE ==>               #Should not stop user interaction or make user wait:
                                  #  - faster enter duration (than exit) when user-driven (e.g. view change, sidebar)
                                  #  - faster exit duration (than enter) when application-driven (e.g. modals or alerts)
                                  #  - no splash screens

EASINGS ==>                       #  - avoid no-linear -> unnatural
                                  #  - avoid ease-in (prefer ease-out) -> feels slow
                                  #  - complex (elastic, bounce) -> only if playful theme

DURATION ==>                      #  - simple: 200-500ms
                                  #  - complex: 800-1200ms

PERFORMANCE ==>                   #See CSS doc
