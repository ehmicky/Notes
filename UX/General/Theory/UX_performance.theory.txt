RAIL PERFORMANCE MODEL ==>        #Respond: 
                                  #  - <100ms so feels immediate 
                                  #  - provide loaders if content not delivered yet.
                                  #  - this means cannot block responsiveness for more than 50ms
                                  #Animate: 
                                  #  - at 60FPS
                                  #Idle time: 
                                  #  - should be used for background tasks and prefetching
                                  #Load: 
                                  #  - <1sec to deliver actual content (including first page load) or user will lose focus 
                                  #  - <10sec or user will quit

CRITICAL PATH ==>                 #Should optimize to provide first paint of viewport quickly:
                                  #  - critical resources: necessary to show first paint of viewport
                                  #  - critical bytes: critical resources size
                                  #  - critical path length: number of networks requests to get critical resourced

RENDERING ==>                     #See DOM doc
ANIMATIONS ==>                    #See CSS doc
