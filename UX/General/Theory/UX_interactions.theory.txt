INTERACTIONS ==>                  #Like dragging, dropping, custom gestures:
                                  #  - single-touch: keep action when held even when not hovering element anymore
                                  #  - multi-touch: stop action when not hovering anymore even when held
                                  #  - start event should be on element itself

MODALS ==>                        #Should be avoided
                                  #Transitions: prefer scaling over shifting
