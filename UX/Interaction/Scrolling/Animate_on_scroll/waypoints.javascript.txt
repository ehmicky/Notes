                                  #  - element ELEM
                                  #  - handler(DIRECTION): DIRECTION is "down|up|left|right". this is WAYPOINT
                                  #  - offset NUM|FUNC()->NUM|STR (def: 0): triggers when ELEM is NUMpx or "NUM%" below top of 
                                  #    screen. Can also be "bottom|right-in-view"

                                  #    SELECTOR only with jQuery build.
                                  #  - continuous BOOL (def: true): non-continuous jump (e.g. jump to end end of page with 
                                  #    anchor) passing several continuous-false waypoints will only trigger the last one
                                  #  - group STR: logical group this waypoint belongs to.
                                  #    Also used by continuous false and next|previous()
