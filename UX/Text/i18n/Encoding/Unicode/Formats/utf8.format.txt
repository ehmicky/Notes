UTF-8 ==>               #Unicode encoding.
                        #Pros:
                        #  - ASCII-compatible
                        #  - ASCII require only 1 character
                        #Cons:
                        #  - U+0800-Uffff require 3 characters
                        #  - Slower to encode|decode
                        #  - Human cannot easily guess codepoint from bytes
                        #Unix (except Mac OS X) uses UTF-8

CESU-8 ==>              #Unicode encoding mixing UTF-8 and UTF-16. Rarely used.

ENDIANNESS ==>          #Applies when iterating through groups of bytes.
                        #But not when iterating through bytes in a group.
BOM ==>                 #Byte Order Mark is therefore useless and discouraged.
                        #Can create issues with shebangs, etc.

BYTE -> CODEPOINT ==>   #  00-7F                   (U+000000-U+00007f)

INVALID BYTES ==>       #Any other is invalid:

                        #  - fails
                        #  - replaced by � (U+FFFD) ? (U+003f) ¿ (U+00bf) or a rectangle with Unicode codepoint number

BYTE -> CODEPOINT       #Explanation:
 CONVERSION ==>         #  - ABCD[EF[GH]]: bytes, hex char by hex char
