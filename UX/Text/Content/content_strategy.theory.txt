CONTENT-FIRST DESIGN ==>          #Content matters more than design, people look for content not design:
                                  #  - design should help people find content 
                                  #  - design should be shaped according to content, as opposed to content being just placeholders

SCANNABLE ==>                     #People do not read word by word, they scan in F-shapes, so must make text scannable: 
                                  #  - highlights: headings, keywords
                                  #  - clear structure: bullet points, one idea per paragraph
                                  #  - straight to the points: minimize number of words, conclusions first, strong intros/headlines, max 70-80 chars per line of text

CREDIBLE ==>                      #  - outbound links
                                  #  - objective tone, no marketing words
                                  #  - good writing (double-check it), but simple understandable language
                                  #  - good graphics, no stock pictures:
                                  #     - must precisely relate to content
                                  #     - must add something to content
                                  #     - must be visually interesting
