GOAL ==>                          #Simple IPC:
                                  #  - no payload except standardized names.
                                  #  - no response
                                  #Unix only

SYNC|ASYNC ==>                    #Sending a signal is sync, since do not wait for response.
                                  #Signal handler can be:
                                  #  - sync:
                                  #     - interrupt process execution
                                  #     - application-level equivalent of a CPU exception
                                  #     - e.g. FPU, segfault, abort
                                  #  - async:
                                  #     - let process handle it when it wants
                                  #     - application-level equivalent of a CPU interrupt (IRQ)
                                  #     - e.g. timer

DEFAULT HANDLER ==>               #Each signal has a default handler:
                                  #  - noop (Ign)
                                  #  - terminate (Term)
                                  #  - terminate and dump to ./core (Core)
                                  #  - pause (Stop)
                                  #  - unpause (Cont)

ALLOWED HANDLER ==>               #Each signal allows:
                                  #  - using the default handler (def)
                                  #  - ignoring default handler
                                  #  - using a different handler
                                  #SIGKILL|SIGSTOP cannot be ignored|handle
                                  #SIGCONT cannot be ignored. It can be handled but the default handler is still performed.
                                  #SIGINT|SIGILL|SIGFPE|SIGSEGV|SIGQUIT|SIGTSTP should not be ignored

BLOCKING|MASKING ==>              #A signal can be blocked: such incoming signals will then be queued until unblocked
                                  #Paused processes block all signals
                                  #SIGKILL|SIGSTOP|SIGCONT cannot be blocked
                                  #Several pending signals of the same signal are queued
                                  #  - except for realtime signals, which are merged to one
                                  #Pending signals are delivered in order
                                  #  - except for realtime signals, which are delivered by signal number order

REALTIME SIGNALS ==>              #Application-specific signals

CHILD PROCESSES ==>               #Inherit signals mask but not handlers
