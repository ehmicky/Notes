VERSION ==>                       #1.0.0-rc.0
                                  #Does GraphQL schema exploration:
                                  #  - includes everything from __schema in introspection (including description, deprecation)
                                  #  - autosorts
                                  #  - can skip Relay-related attributes (Connection|PageInfo|Edge, Node)

<GraphQLVoyager/>                 #React component. Props:
                                  #  - introspection INTROSPECTION_RESP_OBJ[('INTROSPECTION_QUERY')]
                                  #     - 'INTROSPECTION_QUERY' is query containing all possible attributes in __schema
                                  #     - i.e. should just provide a function that:
                                  #        - POST graphQL endpoint
                                  #        - Accept: application/json [C], Content-Type: application/json [C]
                                  #        - request body { query: 'INTROSPECTION_QUERY' }
