ID:
  - always use attribute id, unique and used in URI
  - opaque vs human-friendly:
     - opaque:
        - e.g. incremental integer or UUID
        - prefer decentralized, e.g. UUID, as it allows client to specify new id
        - more stable, i.e. best for lookups
     - human-friendly:
        - e.g. name
        - more subject to change because tied to actual meaning
        - best for search
     - can use both
  - RES_ARR should be array of items with id as attribute, as opposed to object with id as key

Resource relations:
  - subcolls:
    - /COLLS/ID/SUBCOLLS/ID
    - should avoid, use inter-resources links only instead:
      - more flexible to change
      - allow consumers to define own schemas
      - can replace filtering by query e.g. ?coll=ID

Types:
  - time:
    - timestamp ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
    - specify timezone: default one, with possibly allowing customizing per request
  - coordinates: NUM, NUM2
  - numbers: NUM, not "NUM"
  - should denote typing with suffix to attributes:
    - *_hours|mins|seconds|millis|micros|nanos NUM
    - *_date|time DATE|DATETIME
    - *_bytes|width_pixels|height_pixels
    - *_count

Data model:
  - must match client consumption, not just reflect database
  - attribute names should never be user-provided

Semantics:
  - resource-based:
     - goal:
        - simpler interface (knowing the data -> knowing the API)
        - generic enough to provide abstraction layer
     - actions are generic (HTTP methods):
        - GET|HEAD /COLLS -> RES_ARR
        - POST /COLLS -> RES (non-idempotent, e.g. create)
        - PUT /COLLS/ID -> RES (idempotent, e.g. update|upsert)
        - PATCH /COLLS/ID -> RES
           - can just send subsets (e.g. how JSON merge patch works)
           - or define patch operations (e.g. how JSON patch does)
        - DELETE /COLLS/ID -> {}
        - DELETE /COLLS -> {} (dangerous)
        - OPTIONS
     - manipulation through representation (as opposed to using arguments different from RES attributes)
  - should allow X-HTTP-Method-Override, but for POST only
  - upsert:
     - can force update semantics with If-Match [C] or insert semantics with If-None-Match [C]
  - undelete behavior:
     - use DELETE as normal, but updates attribute deleted BOOL instead
     - not shown by queries, except if query parameter show_deleted BOOL
  - status codes: see HTTP doc

Input|output:
  - content type:
    - usually JSON, sometimes YAML, XML, HTML (for humans, e.g. <table>)
    - MIME can be:
       - application/x-collection|resource+json|yaml|xml or text/html
       - application/vnd.VENDOR+json|yaml|xml or text/html
  - input:
    - URI: for identity only
       - avoid: versioning prefix, query variables
    - request body: for contents
    - headers, query variable: for parameters, metadata (prefer headers)
  - input|output:
    - can be wrapped in an "envelope", e.g. under a field (like "data", or "COLL" in singular):
       - pros: allows to add metadata fields to response
       - cons: less intuitive response

Parameters:
  - usual query (usually for GET|HEAD):
    - pagination:
       - max size:
          - limit|page_size|per_page=NUM -> total_size NUM, page_size NUM, page_count NUM
       - offset:
          - request:
             - random access (best when retrieving only part of resource)
                - offset-based (client specifies possible indexes)
                   - offset|page=NUM
                   - or Range [C], Accept-Ranges [S]
                - query-based (client specifies possible values)
                   - timestamp-based:
                      - since|until TIMESTAMP
             - serial access (best when retrieving whole resource in batch)
                - cursor-based:
                   - page_token|before|after=CURSOR|""
                - can make it bidirectional (e.g. with before|after)
          - response:
             - offset-based:
                - offset|page
             - offset|query-based:
                - previous|next link (e.g. next|previous)
             - cursor-based:
                - previous|next token (e.g. next|previous_page_token or cursors.before|after CURSOR|"") +
                  full link with token (e.g. next|previous)
                - CURSOR is often id|offset base64'd
                - can add human-friendly name (or resource.name) next to each TOKEN
             - all:
                - has_previous|next_page BOOL, to avoid extra request
             - encapsulating those information is an object called connection|edges|pageInfo
       - through:
          - response body
          - headers, e.g. Link: <URL>; rel="first|last|prev|next|self" [S]
       - should have default and max values
    - filtering (ATTR=VAL, query|filter=OBJ)
    - selecting (fields=ATTR[(SUBATTR2,...)],...)
    - sorting (sort_by|order_by=ATTR[-|+| asc| desc],..., order=asc|desc)
    - views (server-predefined query) (view=VIEW)
    - populating (populate|embed=VARR,...):
       - return non-populated as child: { id ID } instead of child_id ID as it allows populated response to look more similar
    - aggregating
    - logical order: populating, filtering, sorting, aggregating, paginating, selecting
  - less usual query:
    - i18n (see HTTP doc)
    - datetime (see HTTP doc)
  - usual mutation parameters:
    - dry-run (validate_only=true)

RPC/actions:
  - try to avoid, but sometimes REST makes no sense for some type of action/resource
  - should use [/...][/actions]/ACTION
  - should use method that hast best semantics, but generally is POST
  - e.g.:
     - API status, monitoring
     - rate limits
  - alternative is to map to an entity attribute, and fire action on attribute value change

Async:
  - can:
     - keep status in an attribute of same model, e.g. status
     - return status in response, with 202
     - return status, as separate "operation" [sub]resource, with 202
  - status|operation attributes:
     - status: at least not_started, running, succeeded, error, but potentially more
     - created_time
     - updated_time
     - percent_complete FLOAT
     - resource_location: target resource
  - might allow cancelling, e.g. DELETE "operation" resource
  - client either:
     - poll, e.g. Retry-After [C]
     - wait for push (including web hooks)
  - too long running operations should become tombstones, i.e. cannot be queried but are still persisted for debug

Concurrency:
  - idempotency|retries:
    - can be achieved with non-idempotent methods by:
       - including unique ID in request
       - returning cached response if matches a previous request ID
  - see HTTP doc for conflicts resolution

Realtime:
  - see HTTP doc

URL:
  - root URL should be short|simple, e.g.:
     - https://api.DOMAIN/
        - better security-wise, with same-origin policy
        - easier with the tools that think DOMAIN-wise
     - https://DOMAIN/api/
        - easier to setup
  - /COLLS[/ID]

Naming:
  - COLLS plural
  - not too generic, but easy to understand for non-native speakers
  - only [:alnum:]_, both path names and attributes underscored
  - use names, not verbs (unless RPC action)

Documentation:
  - document:
    - response codes
    - error messages
    - type
    - allowed values|chars|regexp
    - value constraints|validation
    - default value
    - example value
    - value units (e.g. milliseconds)
    - idempotency
    - side effects
    - authentication
    - versioning scheme
    - deprecation, stability
  - provide:
    - API console for experimentation
    - example of client code in different codes (including CLI, e.g. curl)
  - do not truncate examples

Hypermedia/HATEOAS:
  - client discover URLs endpoints at runtime:
     - no need to know beforehand
     - can change URLs without breaking compatibility
  - how:
     - root URL gives:
        - list of possible resources/collections
        - list of versions
        - list of features
     - each resource give links to others:
        - each resource (including subresource) has its own URL as attribute (e.g. href|self attribute)
        - each subresource has its link type, related to parent, as attribute (e.g. link attribute)
           - example link types: collection/COLL, resource/RES
        - can render only href+link, and let client populate, follow or neither
        - can also use Link [S]
  - self-documentation:
     - OPTIONS -> Allow [S]: allowed methods
     - OPTIONS -> Link: <DOC_URI>; rel="help"
     - any other way to get same info as documentation, using HATEOAS principle
  - self-describing resources:
     - contains their type as attribute (e.g. _type "TYPE", or !TYPE in YAML)

Third-party:
  - provide a sandbox environment:
     - similar to a "stage" environment, but for third-party developers only
     - URI e.g. api.DOMAIN -> api.sandbox.DOMAIN
  - if will create integration, i.e. must act on behalf of user, use OAuth or similar

Formatting:
  - can provide pretty=BOOL parameter, to beautify output:
     - pros: easier to read|debug
     - cons: bigger payload, but not too much of an issue with compression
  - should beautify by default

State:
  - should enforce stateless:
     - goals:
        - scalable: server does not need to store state
        - simple:
           - server does not have to deal with state
           - proxies do not need to remember session information
        - reliable: failure has smaller granularity (partial request)
        - monitoring|debugging: no need to track sessions
     - exceptions:
        - rate limiting
        - protocol-specific multi-request actions (e.g. OAuth)
     - cookies are stateless (sent with every request) providing server does not store session

Proxies:
  - should think that there might be proxies in the middle

Decoupling:
  - protocol-independent: not only HTTP (e.g. WebSocket)
  - transformation layers:
    - from|to REST API consumers (view layer)
    - from|to backend|database (model layer)
  - use middleware: clear division in input|output stages
  - content negotiation:
     - input: can accept several types, using Content-Type [C]
     - output: can accept several types, using Accept [C]

Observability:
  - analytics:
     - including to deprecated endpoints|parameters
     - create[d]|update[d]|delete[d]_time|at TIMESTAMP
  - logging:
     - use request|response_id

Errors:
  - "problem detail":
    (standard "application/problem+json|xml"):
    - status NUM:
       - HTTP status code
       - might be different from response's if a proxy changed it
    - type 'URI':
       - error generic identifier
       - if resolvable, must point to human-readable description, e.g. HTML
       - prefer absolute URIs
       - specific to a given status code
       - "about:blank" (def):
          - use status code number
          - title should be status code string (possibly i18n'd)
    - title STR:
       - short description
       - 1 type === 1 title
       - can be i18n'd, but should avoid (makes it harder to debug)
    - description STR (long): no i18n
    - instance 'URI' (object)
       - resource that created the error
       - prefer absolute URIs
    - errors OBJ_ARR (like JavaScript ERROR.errors)
    (non standard)
    - innererror OBJ (like JavaScript ERROR.cause)
    - code NUM (generic identifier)
    - more_info|url|error_uri URL
    - details STR:
       - longer debug info, e.g. stack trace
       - goal is to help end-user fix the problem
          - should not try to help developer debug nor contain trace info
          - meant for end-user not programatic|parsing usage
     - any other VAR:
        - unprefixed [[:alnum:]_]
        - min 3 chars
  - status code: see HTTP doc
  - everything might be enclosed in error attribute, e.g. { error: { status ... } }
  - should validate input

Security:
  - Authentication
  - Authorization
  - Rate limiting, using X-RateLimit-Limit|Remaining|Reset [S]
  - Timeout
  - HTTPS only, no redirect
  - CORS

Performance:
  - use caching
  - use byte serving
  - use compression
  - use delta encoding
  - use prefetching, server push
  - send header before body
  - use partial body, empty body
  - use stream prioritization

Compatibility
  - versioning can be put in either:
     - URL: https://DOMAIN/vMAJOR/: more developer-friendly, and easy to see when use wrong one
     - header: Accept: TYPE; version=MAJOR [C]: more semantically correct
        - can also respond with X-Version: MAJOR.MINOR [S]
  - no default version, must be explicit
  - general (see compatiblity doc, this is summary):
     - provide forward compatibility
     - use versioning (changelog, semver)
     - introduce breaking changes in stages
     - document stability level
     - use support branches
  - can:
     - use redirects
