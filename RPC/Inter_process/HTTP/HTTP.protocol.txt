STANDARDS ==>                     #RFCs mostly (see below)

GOAL ==>                          #Application-layer adding CRUD actions on [linked] generic whole resources:
                                  #  - whole: as opposed to parts of resources
                                  #  - generic: rich generic semantics with no assumption of type|format|purpose
                                  #  - linked:
                                  #     - good support for links between resources
                                  #     - hence good for documents
                                  #     - generic semantics reduce probability of broken links
                                  #Oriented:
                                  #  - more towards consumption: client-server, proxies-friendly

                                  #Properties:
                                  #  - good efficiency
                                  #  - poor security, rely on TLS instead
                                  #On TCP/IP
                                  #Wide support:

LAYERS ==>                        #  - application layer

                                  #     - TCP ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

VERSIONING ==>                    #Current:

                                  #     - no response body
                                  #  - server (missing Upgrade [C])
                                  #     - 426 (Upgrade Required)
                                  #Upgrade [C] allowed with HTTP/1.1 -> HTTP/2, but not with HTTP/2 -> *

TUNNELING ==>                     #Goal:
                                  #  - wrapping another protocol packets in HTTP
                                  #  - either:
                                  #     - proxy and endpoints wraps|unwraps request|response
                                  #     - initial setup is done with HTTP, then proxy forwards the other protocol
                                  #Advantages:
                                  #  - compatibility with existing software, including firewalls
                                  #  - with HTTPS, can completely hide the other protocol packet
                                  #    (including which protocol it is)
                                  #  - can use HTTP features, e.g. caching
                                  #Problems:
                                  #  - adds HTTP features that might not be needed -> complexity
                                  #  - slower
                                  #Should register|use different:
                                  #  - URI scheme or HTTP methods: if very different from HTTP usual behavior
                                  #  - port: if separate from HTTP server (different goal|traffic|data)
                                  #  - status codes: never, should instead reuse existing ones and make sure it
                                  #    matches behavior:
                                  #     - because proxies will behave according to status code (e.g. for caching)
                                  #     - if nothing matches, use general ones like 200 or 500
                                  #How:
                                  #  - CONNECT:
                                  #     - how:
                                  #        - client:
                                  #           - HTTP method CONNECT (unsafe non-idempotent)
                                  #           - URI: ORIGIN only
                                  #           - no request body
                                  #        - server:
                                  #           - 2**
                                  #           - (HTTP/2) can use CONNECT_ERROR (0xa) error code
                                  #        - then server will forward the TCP connection used by HTTP request
                                  #           - it will only forward without interpreting, i.e. can be any TCP-based protocol,
                                  #             including HTTP
                                  #     - intented for forward proxies

CACHING ==>                       #Vocabulary:
                                  #  - cache hits ratio: % of requests that used cache instead
                                  #  - stale resource (as opposed to fresh): cached but not valid anymore
                                  #  - cache invalidation: removing caching on stale resources
                                  #Types:
                                  #  - client caching:
                                  #     - best performance but for single client
                                  #     - e.g. browser caching
                                  #  - server caching:
                                  #     - shared by many clients but less performant
                                  #     - types:
                                  #        - reverse proxy (between client and server)
                                  #        - between server and database (e.g. Memcached/Redis)
                                  #What is cached:
                                  #  - key:
                                  #     - HTTP method
                                  #     - URI, excluding #HASH
                                  #     - HTTP headers, if Vary: HEADER,... [S]:
                                  #        - whitespaces, orders, case, identical values will be normalized before comparison
                                  #        - if unconditional caching failed because of different HTTP headers:
                                  #           - client should try conditional caching
                                  #           - but if client does not implement this HEADER, it might not send it, e.g.:
                                  #              - CLIENT_1 -> HEADER    -> PROXY -> HEADER                          -> SERVER -> 2** Vary: HEADER
                                  #              - CLIENT_2 -> no HEADER -> PROXY -> no HEADER (conditional caching) -> SERVER -> 304
                                  #                 - here CLIENT_2 gets same response as CLIENT_1 even though HEADER varied
                                  #           - solutions:
                                  #              - use new status code understood (thus cached) only by clients/proxies that implement HEADER
                                  #                 - ex: 226 for delta encoding
                                  #                 - problem: some clients/proxies cache any unknown status codes
                                  #              - solutions like Cache-Control: im (delta encoding)
                                  #        - HEADER can be *
                                  #        - can significantly increase reverse proxy cache size
                                  #        - use case:
                                  #           - when headers have impact on content, i.e. usually on Accept* [C]
                                  #           - usually towards proxies, since browsers usually use only one set of headers
                                  #     - does not include request body
                                  #  - value: full response (URI, headers, body)
                                  #HTTP methods allowed:
                                  #  - GET
                                  #  - HEAD: theoritically. But web browsers do not seem to allow it.
                                  #  - others: only with conditional caching (except If-Modified-Since), when manually added using XHR
                                  #Status codes:
                                  #  - specified as:

UNCONDITIONAL CACHING ==>         #Goal:
                                  #  - client uses cache for a given time period, without server interaction
                                  #  - has priority over conditional caching
                                  #Features:
                                  #  - fastest cache method
                                  #  - highest probability of stale resources, except when using timestamping or invalidation push
                                  #  - best for asset files

MODULEPRELOAD ==>                 #Like 'preload' except optimized for ES modules, i.e. <script type="module">:
                                  #  - does ES modules parsing
                                  #  - ignores "crossorigin" HTML attribute in cache key
                                  #  - some browsers will also preload dependencies (i.e. from "import"), but using a flat list
                                  #    is better

SERVER PUSH STREAM ==>            #(HTTP/2)
                                  #Send additional resources in a single response
                                  #How:
                                  #  - enabled by SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH (0x2) (def: true)
                                  #  - initiated by server, in reaction to client request
                                  #  - server: PUSH_PROMISE frame:
                                  #     - contains HEADERS frame information that client would send if it was to request this stream
                                  #     - the original request cannot contain request body
                                  #     - the pushed request must be cacheable, e.g. use safe method
                                  #  - client:
                                  #     - RST_STREAM frame with CANCEL|REFUSED_STREAM error code to cancel request, e.g. if cached
                                  #     - server reacts to RST_STREAM but does not wait for client to send next frames
                                  #  - server:
                                  #     - HEADERS, DATA: like normal response
                                  #Performance:
                                  #  - less roundtrips than resource hints
                                  #  - but should push only resources that would have been requested
                                  #Caching:
                                  #  - uses pseudo-client request for caching, so works the same as normal request
                                  #  - client request must be cacheable, i.e. GET with cache headers
                                  #Need to be initiated by a request (so not realtime)
                                  #As opposed to resource hints, coming from server so cannot be used if:
                                  #  - client needs knowledge about fetching: resource path, load|error event
                                  #  - fetching needs knowledge about client: state (cookies, localStorage), user agent info (Accept [C], etc.)

RESOURCE HINTS ==>                #Use Link [S] (or <link>) REL
                                  # ATTR:
                                  #  - pr 'FLOAT' (0-1) (all)
                                  #     - probability the link will be followed
                                  #     - used for prioritization or reducing optimization/fetching
                                  #  - as TYPE (preload|prefetch):
                                  #     - WINDOW.fetch() destination type,
                                  #       i.e. script|style|image|font|media|object|embed|document|xslt|manifest|report|service|shared]worker
                                  #     - used for CSP and Accept [C]
                                  #  - nopush (preload): if a HTTP2 server push has been received for that resource, do not use it
                                  #Prerender parsing/execution:
                                  #  - in the background, i.e. not visible but will provide very fast cache
                                  #  - only kept for short while, so should be next navigation
                                  #  - resource intensive: should only be used when confident about next navigation action
                                  #  - only HTML resources
                                  #  - can debug with about:net-internals#prerender (Chrome)
                                  #DNS prefetching:
                                  #  - already done by browsers on <a|area href>
                                  #  - can disable with <meta http-equiv="x-dns-prefetch-control" content="off">/
                                  #Does not delay document.onload
                                  #Could previously use noop XHR to achieve something similar
                                  #Can be:
                                  #  - speculative: before user interaction that might trigger HTTP request
                                  #  - reactive: after user interaction that will certainly trigger HTTP request, after some delay
                                  #Possible problems:
                                  #  - when HTTP GET request has side effects (which is improper)
                                  #  - increase bandwith usage
                                  #  - overestimate tracking (ads, analytics):
                                  #     - can use document.visibilityState 'prerender' to handle it
                                  #  - security: website make decision (not user) to trust content by browsing it
                                  #  - cannot see in devtools network tab, but can see "prerender" using chrome://net-internals/#prerender

EARLY HINTS ==>                   #Status code 103 (Early Hints):
                                  #  - partial response, with only headers that will *probably* be in final response
                                  #     - not about headers that will probably *not* be in final response
                                  #  - goal is to hint at headers before even knowing status code
                                  #  - informational status code, i.e.:
                                  #     - emitted before final response
                                  #     - can be emitted several times, in which case successive 103s can omit headers
                                  #       present in previous ones
                                  #  - often used for prefetching Link [S]
