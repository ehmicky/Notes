VERSION ==>                   #Version from 2013/12/31

GOAL ==>                      #Like S3 but for not frequent backups, few objects, almost never retrieval, high storage size:
                              #  - three times cheaper storage costs
                              #     - but metadata is 40KB/object, not 8KB like S3 (so should zip files)
                              #     - always pay first three months, even if deleted during that time
                              #  - same transfer costs
                              #  - writes 10 times more expensive
                              #  - reads like listing are same price
                              #  - other reads (like restoring) are:
                              #     - 300 times more expensive, but it should be almost nothing if only few a month
                              #     - with additional cost GB/day, using highest daily average of the month
                              #        - Substract 0.16%/total stored size from it (free)
                              #        - So should spread over time as much as possible to make it fit in the free 0.16%
                              #  - reads much slower (min. 5 hours)
                              #If keeping few number of objects and transactions with high storage size, will be about three 
                              #times cheaper than S3 providing not retrieving too much and can spread over time a lot.

S3 ==>                        #Can use Lifecycle with S3 to create|restore Glacier, which helps transition from S3 to Glacier,
                              #but has less features than using Glacier directly (no control on how long to restore, etc.)
                              #Should use Glacier for objects that don't need to use S3 in the first place.

LIMITS ==>                    #Vault:
                              #  - 1000 vaults
                              #  - unlimited archives

                              #Archive:
                              #  - 4GB size, 40TB if Multipart write.
                              
ARN ==>                       #  - vault: "arn:aws:glacier:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:vaults/VAULT" (can include *)
                              #  - archive: none. But can assign Archive permissions (e.g. deleteArchive) to a vault.
