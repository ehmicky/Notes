MOBILE FIRST ==>                  #Start design with small screens, with touch

ADAPTATION ==>                    #  - responsive: client-side adaptation
                                  #  - adaptive: server-side adaptation:
                                  #     - client-side redirection (different URL)
                                  #     - server-side redirection

SINGLE URL ==>                    #  - better SEO (see SEO doc)
                                  #  - easier to distribute

SINGLE CONTENT PER WEBSITE ==>    #  - easier to maintain
                                  #  - works better with window resize
                                  #  - less risk to be considered cloaking (see SEO doc)
                                  #  - might be harder to personalize experience
                                  #  - must download more bytes

RESPONSIVE LAYOUT CHANGES ==>     #More complex layout changes:
                                  #  - increase maintainance
                                  #  - decrease familiarity across devices
                                  #  - but allows fitter experience for each size, and might be necessary for complex content
                                  #From less to more complex:
                                  #  - tiny tweaks: keep layout, only e.g. increase font size
                                  #  - mostly fluid: stack flexbox-style
                                  #  - column drop: like mostly fluid, but when stacked to next column, elements take width 100%
                                  #  - off canvas: hide elements in dynamic menus
                                  #  - layout shifter: complete layout change
                                  #Should also show all content on any size.
                                  #Breakpoints should be based on content, not specific devices.
