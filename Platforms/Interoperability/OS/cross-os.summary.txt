AVAILABLE UTILITIES ==>           #Different core utils:
                                  #  - core OS syscalls are different
                                  #  - core utils are different, e.g. Windows has no coreutils nor Bash
                                  #  - usual application are different, e.g. `notepad.exe` instead of `vi` on Windows
                                  #Windows emulations on Unix:
                                  #  - Wine
                                  #Unix emulations on Windows:
                                  #  - msys/MinGW (part of Git Bash)
                                  #  - Cygwin: more extensive, similar to Wine but inverse
                                  #  - WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): alternative to Cygwin more focused on Linux

NEWLINE ==>                       #CR+LF on Windows, LR on Unix:
                                  #  - on terminal|file I/O
                                  #  - some applications (e.g. text editors) abstract this though
                                  #'\n' is always LF and '\r' always CR (OS-agnostic)

SETTINGS/CONFIGURATION ==>        #Different typical directories:
                                  #  - typical temporary directory: `/tmp` on Linux, `/var/folders/RANDOM/T` on Mac, `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp` on Windows
                                  #  - typical home directory: `/home/USER` on Linux, `/Users/USER` on Max, `C:\Users\USER` on Windows
                                  #Configuration:
                                  #  - Unix: usually files in some predefined directory like `/etc/*`
                                  #  - Windows: usually inside the Windows registry, a central key-value store

PATHS ==>                         #Delimiter is / on Unix, \ on Windows
                                  #  - although / is most of the time (but not always) allowed on Windows
                                  #Absolute path on Windows:
                                  #  - '\' (current drive)
                                  #  - 'LETTER:\'
                                  #     - can use even with relative paths, e.g. `C:path` is relative but `C:\path` is not
                                  #  - '\\HOST\' or '//HOST\' ("UNC path")

SYMLINKS ==>                      #Windows:
                                  #  - can use `junctions`, i.e. like hard link but actually mirrors
                                  #  - cannot create hard links on folders
                                  #  - has a 'create symlink' permission, which by default is only given to admins
                                  #FAT32 does not allow symlinks

PERMISSIONS ==>                   #Main mechanism is different:
                                  #  - Unix uses POSIX permissions (chmod(), umask(), stat().mode, etc.)
                                  #  - Windows use a combination of:
                                  #     - file attributes:
                                  #        - readonly: no write|delete permission (regular file only)
                                  #        - hidden:
                                  #           - not listed by parent directory
                                  #           - there are options to turn it off both in CLI and GUI, unless `system` attribute is also set
                                  #        - system: used by OS
                                  #        - directory: is directory
                                  #        - reparse point: is symlink
                                  #        - others are not related to file permissions
                                  #     - file permissions / ACLs / NTFS permissions
                                  #     - share permissions
                                  #Executability on Windows:
                                  #  - means can be passed to an interpreter (since there is no shabang)
                                  #  - besides other permissions, also require extension to be among ENVVAR PATHEXT,
                                  #    a ;-separated list of file extensions
                                  #     - def: .COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC
                                  #User identification: UID|GID on Unix, SID on Windows

COMMANDS EXECUTION ==>            #Shabang does not work on Windows, i.e. must always use an iterpreter (e.g. `node FILE`)
                                  #  - exceptions: `*.exe|com|cmd|bat`
                                  #File extension can be omitted if inside PATHEXT on Windows
                                  #ENVVAR PATH:
                                  #  - delimiter is : on Unix and ; on Windows not :
                                  #  - different directories

SHELL ==>                         #cmd.exe is very different from Bash:
                                  #  - no ; but it has &&
                                  #  - flags use /OPT instead of "OPT"
                                  #  - escaping:
                                  #     - ^-escaping or "" for ^ & < > |
                                  #     - optional ^-escaping or "" for ' ` , ; = ( ) !
                                  #     - optional ^-escaping or "" for \-escaping for \ [ ] " . * ?
                                  #     - optional "-escaping for "
                                  #  - uses CP866 charset instead of Unicode

ENVVARS ==>                       #Referencing:
                                  #  - $ENVVAR in Unix, %ENVVAR% in Windows
                                  #  - if missing, '' in Unix, '%ENVVAR%' as is in Windows
                                  #Passing:
                                  #  - ENVVAR=VAL in Unix
                                  #  - Set ENVVAR=VAL or setx ENVVAR VAL [/M] in Windows (/M if requires admin)
                                  #Listing: `env` in Unix, `set` in Windows
                                  #Case-insensitive on Windows, case-sensitive on Unix
                                  #Different names:
                                  #  - ComSpec on Windows, SHELL on Unix
                                  #  - PROMPT on Windows, PS1 on Unix
                                  #  - PWD in Unix, CD on Windows
                                  #  - HOME in Unix, HOMEDRIVE|HOMEPATH on Windows
                                  #  - TMPDIR in Unix, T[E]MP on Windows
                                  #  - USER on Unix, `USERDOMAIN\USERNAME` on Windows
                                  #  - COMPUTERNAME on Windows, HOSTNAME on Unix
                                  #     - can also use CLI command `hostname` (cross-OS)

INTER-PROCESS ==>                 #Windows does not have signals:
                                  #  - `taskkill` command can be used to terminate processes
                                  #Signals integers are different between Linux and Mac, and some signals are different

NETWORKING ==>                    #Sockets/named pipes on Windows must be prefixed with `\\.\pipe\`
                                  #Cannot `listen()` to a file descriptor on Windows
