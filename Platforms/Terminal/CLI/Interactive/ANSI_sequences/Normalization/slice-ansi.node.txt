VERSION ==>                       #7.1.0

SLICE-ANSI(STR, NUM[, NUM2])->STR #Like STR.slice(NUM[, NUM2]), but handles:
                                  #  - ANSI sequences (only \e[~m)
                                  #     - counted as 0 width
                                  #     - not cut in the middle, nor leaving start sequence without end sequence
                                  #     - using ANSI-STYLES (see its doc)
                                  #  - fullwidth code points
                                  #     - counted as 2 widths
                                  #     - using IS-FULLWIDTH-CODE-POINT and ASTRAL-REGEX (see their doc)
                                  #Duration is O(NUM2), so faster to slice the beginning than the end
