PCI COMPLIANCE ==>                #See PCI docs.

                                  #  - stores sensitive information
                                  #     - i.e. never returned in response, only in request payloads
                                  #  - front-end code (checkout, Elements, mobile SDK, Terminal, Connect) handles it,
                                  #    i.e. never handled by our front-end or server code
                                  #     - i.e. needs to use those to be PCI compliant
                                  #  - validation: just need to click it every 3 month in dashboard, providing:
                                  #     - not creating charges manually via HTTP or via Dashboard (instead of Elements, etc.)
                                  #     - not level 1
                                  #        - for level 1, can also offer help (must contact them), reducing audit time from 3 months to 1 week
                                  #There is a section in Dashboard about current status, and documents to upload.

SCA COMPLIANCE ==>                #Must use 3D secure for 'card' payments. I.e. must use PINTENT.

MIGRATING ==>                     #Check online doc how to migrate from|to Stripe from|to another provider:
                                  #  - it's not easy and might be impossible if new provider is not PCI compliant
                                  #  - from one Stripe account to another: can contact support

AVAILABLE SOURCE TYPES ==>        #Credit card companies controlled (banks are clients):

                                  #         - banks asks for online password, on-device code or biometric
                                  #      - also called 'Visa Secure' or 'Mastercard Identity Check'

                                  #         - Stripe automatically try to ask for exemptions if possible
                                  #      - can send email with instructions on how to proceed:
                                  #         - on every payment, or on payments that don't complete
                                  #         - must be configured through Dashboard settings

                                  #            - more automated, less effort from customer but more risk of dispute
                                  #            - much cheaper Stripe fee than other payment methods
                                  #         - 'credit': customer puts money to our account
                                  #            - absolute Stripe fee instead of relative, i.e. cheaper for big amounts
                                  #      - 'debit' requires bank account to be verified:
                                  #         - done either through:
                                  #            - using another paid tool Plaid: https://stripe.com/docs/ach#using-plaid

                                  #               - bank statement is "AMTS:" followed by a secret number
                                  #               - customer needs to tell us those two numbers

DISPUTE ==>                       #When a CUSTOMER questions our CHARGE. Also called "chargebacks".
                                  #Possible causes:
                                  #  - they did not authorize it (e.g. done with a stolen card) (most common cause)
                                  #  - they did not receive the product/service
                                  #  - wrong billing (e.g. transaction sent twice to bank)
                                  #  - technical (e.g. expired authorization)

INQUIRIES/RETRIEVALS ==>          #  - DISPUTE early stage where money was not taken from ACCOUNT yet
                                  #  - only done by American Express and Discover, not Mastercard nor Visa
                                  #  - should handle like a normal DISPUTE
                                  #  - status 'warning_needs_response', 'warning_under_review' and either 'warning_closed' or 'charge_refunded'
                                  #     - equivalent of 'needs_response', 'under_review', 'won' or 'lost'

WITHDRAWAL ==>                    #Should always talk to customer, and try to fix the problem and make them withdraw the dispute.
                                  #If customer wants to withdraw, should consider approving dispute and charging them again instead
                                  #  - like this, faster process (no need to wait 10 weeks to settle the dispute)

TYPICAL FRAUDS ==>                #  - stolen cards
                                  #  - overpayment / payout scam:
                                  #     - using a stolen card, make a purchase
                                  #     - then ask seller to make a purchase back (e.g. pay for their favorite freight company)
                                  #     - then cancel first purchase
                                  #  - alternative refunds:
                                  #     - using a stolen card, make a purchase but pays too much
                                  #     - then ask seller to make a refund
                                  #     - then cancel first purchase
                                  #  - marketplace: when running a marketplace and one user pays another, but product/service is not delivered
                                  #  - card testing:
                                  #     - trying a stolen card on a website that allow very small purchases (e.g.  donations)
                                  #     - should prevent with CAPTCHAs or rate limiting

SIGNS OF FRAUD ==>                #  - fake information (emails, phone numbers)
                                  #  - different information across purchases (emails, payment methods, shipping|billing addresses, IP)
                                  #  - scripted communication
                                  #     - should google sentences
                                  #  - expensive or very frequent purchases
                                  #  - splitting purchases (including refunds) over several payment methods
                                  #  - asking us to process payment manually (so that IP address / responsability is ours)
                                  #  - amount higher than required
                                  #  - wrong CVC
                                  #  - addresses mismatches
                                  #     - shipping vs billing vs card|bank account's owner (AVS check)
                                  #     - often legitimate (gift purchase), but raise warnings
                                  #  - change of address after purchase
                                  #  - ask for different shipping

AVOIDING DISPUTES ==>             #Billing:
                                  #  - using 3D secure makes us less liable to disputes.
                                  #  - provide a good *.statement_descriptor
                                  #  - send receipts
                                  #  - should always collect: name, email, card CVC, full billing address (including ZIP), shipping address (if different)
                                  #  - use ACCOUNT.settings.card_payments.decline_on.cvc_failure true
                                  #  - do not refund on a different credit card / bank account (to avoid frauds)
                                  #Fraudulent-looking payments:
                                  #  - should delay it:
                                  #     - delay payment by capturing it (CHARGE.capture)
                                  #     - delay shipping by 1-2 days
                                  #  - if already accepted, should refund it
                                  #Identification:
                                  #  - auth with social media accounts or bank services (e.g. BankID)
                                  #Communication:
                                  #  - good communication / customer service
                                  #  - clear refund and cancellation policies
                                  #     - should be agreed on (as part of terms of service)
                                  #     - should be presented in full text (not just link)
                                  #  - reach out to user through the contact information verified by bank
                                  #Shipping:
                                  #  - choose delivery service that:
                                  #     - requires signature on delivery
                                  #     - has good tracking
                                  #  - ship to the exact same address provided by customer
                                  #  - be fast to ship, and communicate delays
                                  #  - save shipping labels
                                  #  - protective packaging

HIGH DISPUTE RATE ==>             #If for one month, for >5000 USD, either:
                                  #  - dispute rate (won or lost) >1% per CHARGE count
                                  #  - dispute rate lost to fraud >8% per CHARGE money, for >10 transactions
                                  #Then:
                                  #  - Stripe (and competitors) might cancel account
                                  #  - Credit card companies might:
                                  #     - charge higher dispute fees
                                  #     - blacklist wth TMFs (Terminated Merchant Files)
                                  #        - MATCH is Mastercard's one and is commonly used
                                  #         - can happen too if:
                                  #            - failing to protect payment method data or comply to PCI
                                  #     - give hefty fines ($10,000 to $100,000)
                                  #Credit card companies have warning programs:
                                  #  - if about to hit threshold, give warnings
                                  #  - then must tell them how we want to fix it
                                  #  - give few months to fix it
