COPYRIGHT HOLDER ==>    #Can always change the license.
                        #  - but only for new releases (not retroactive)
                        #Any license issue can be fixed with written authorization from copyright holder.
                        #When several contributors (e.g. GitHub PRs), each is a copyright holder
                        #  - e.g. cannot change the license of whole project without asking them
                        #  - can make them sign a CLA to donate their copyright to organization instead

MULTI-LICENSING ==>     #Possible goals:
                        #  - copyleft license for non-commercial, prioprietary for commercial
                        #  - cumulating constraints of two licenses
                        #  - allow users picking the license they want. Issues:
                        #     - license incompability can arise
                        #     - if one license is less permissive, cannot contribute back/upstream
                        #Note also that different versions can also apply on:
                        #  - different versions of same project
                        #  - different files

OPEN-SOURCE LICENSES ==>#Always allow freedom to:
                        #  - use (implies free price)
                        #  - read sources
                        #  - copy
                        #  - modify

COPYLEFT ==>            #Require copies/derivatives to keep same license
                        #  - if "strong copyleft", also apply to linking
                        #When combining projects, stronger license prevails for the whole
                        #  - except for loose bundling is allowed
                        #  - providing licenses are compatible
                        #"Permissive" is when no copyleft.

FAIR USE ==>            #Does not need to respect license when using under fair use.

TIVOIZATION ==>         #When software is free but must be used with non-free hardware (e.g. DRM)

ATTRIBUTION CLAUSE ==>  #Must name copyright holder.
                        #Usually must also include original license.
                        #Sometimes must also indicate when changes/patches were made.
                        #Also called advertising clause.
                        #Issue: list of attributions can become long in big projects.

NON-ENDORSEMENT CLAUSE
 ==>                    #Cannot use copyright name for promotion purpose.

OPEN DATA ==>           #  - format: machine-readable, open
                        #  - no restrictions, similar to open source
                        #  - discoverable
                        #     - e.g. known websites like datahub.io or github

DATA LICENSING ==>      #Difference between:
                        #  - database/structure/model
                        #  - content

CREATIVE COMMONS ==>    #Clauses:
                        #  - BY: attribution
                        #     - must keep license files as is
                        #     - must state origin of that part
                        #     - must say when part has been modified
                        #  - SA: share-alike, similar to copyleft
                        #  - NC: no commercial (not free)
                        #     - cannot be mixed with CC SA
                        #     - but bundling is ok

                        #     - but can bundle with other parts
                        #Specific licenses:
                        #  - CC0:
                        #     - no clauses
                        #     - also it relinquishes any copyright/ownership, i.e. puts in public domain.
                        #  - PDM (Public Domain Mark):
                        #     - states that something is already in public domain (as opposed to CC0 which puts it in public domain)
                        #Use in:
                        #  - data:
                        #     - CC 4.0 became more applicable to data. Previous versions were not.
                        #        - covers both database/structure and content
                        #     - attribution (BY) is hard with data, i.e. CC0 is usually preferred
                        #  - software:
                        #     - better for non-code, e.g. picture, video, data, text.
                        #     - explicitly does not cover patents (e.g. like Apache does)

OPEN DATA COMMONS ==>   #Licenses:
                        #  - PDDL (Public Domain and Dedication): similar to CC0
                        #  - ODCAL (Open Data Commons Attribution): similar to CC-BY
                        #  - ODbL (Open Database): similar to CC-BY-SA
                        #Difference with Creative Commons:
                        #  - database/structure only, not content
                        #     - DbCL is a separate license meant for content
