PSD2 ==>                          #EU directive:
                                  #  - SCA (Strong Customer Authentication)
                                  #  - forces banks to allow customer to share data to third-parties, through APIs

CONDITIONS ==>                    #Both:
                                  #  - business is in EU
                                  #  - users (their banks) are in in EU
                                  #In practice some EU banks might enforce it even if business is not in EU.

SCA ==>                           #Requires 2-factor auth on credit card payments
                                  #  - among knowledge (e.g. password), possession (e.g. device), inherence (e.g. biometrics)
                                  #3D secure is SCA-compliant
                                  #Exemptions:
                                  #  - can be requested to banks
                                  #     - banks use contextual data sent to them: device ID, transaction history, address, etc.
                                  #  - if low dispute rate, Stripe/PayPal can assess|grant it without asking bank
                                  #     - must be <0.13% for <100€, <0.06% for <250€, <0.01% for <500€
                                  #  - only if one of:
                                  #     - <30€, providing not used 5 times in a row
                                  #     - fixed amount subscriptions
                                  #     - variable amount subscriptions, providing there is an agreement ("mandate")
                                  #     - phone sales
