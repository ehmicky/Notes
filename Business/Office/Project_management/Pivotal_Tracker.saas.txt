USER STORIES ==>              #  - Can be features, bug fixes, releases, 
                              #    chores (user stories with no added value for customer)

                              #  - Can apply labels, and use them to categorize epic stories

ITERATIONS ==>                #  - 1 week by def.
                              #  - Each user stories (features only) has points (can choose scales, def. is 1-3)
                              #  - Velocity: average points done / 3 weeks (by def.)
                              #  - Rearrange panels accordingly: 
                              #     - done: must Start > Finish > Deliver > Accept|Reject (If Reject, restart)
                              #     - current
                              #     - backlog: features to be done but not this iteration
                              #     - icebox: features considered to be added to the backlog
