OBJECTIONS|PROBLEMS RAISER ==>    #Solutions:
                                  #  - transfer responsability to solve objection to person raising it
                                  #  - question the objection, e.g. clarifying ambiguous wording or unjustified claims

TECHNOLOGY UNSOUND CHOICES ==>    #Reasons:
                                  #  - "corporate shark": powerful position because of good people skills, as opposed to technical skills
                                  #  - "bonus monster": decision taken by sales, for short-term profit
                                  #  - "egomaniac":
                                  #     - decision taken by desire to maintain a dominant figure
                                  #     - solution: arguying against the unsound choice, while still recognizing their ego
                                  #  - "technological bigot", "anachronist": 
                                  #     - lack of expertise, only following IT hype
                                  #     - solution: offering formation

                                  #  - social non-work-related gathering of colleagues

EMAIL COMMUNICATION ==>           #Be careful with it because:
                                  #  - lacks empathy that real meeting have
