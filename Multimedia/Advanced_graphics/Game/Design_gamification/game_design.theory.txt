CONTINGENCY ==>                   #Rule to get a reward: 
                                  #  - fun comes from the condition, i.e. that is only applies if certain circumstances fulfilled 
                                  #Ratio vs intervals:
                                  #  - ratio: happens when action happened NUM times
                                  #  - intervals: happens when NUM seconds passed
                                  #     - i.e. action performed by user is e.g. to wait or check a specific place where reward would appear
                                  #Fixed vs variable:
                                  #  - fixed: NUM is constant
                                  #     - low incentive to start (which leads to initial pause), but big incentive to fulfill while started
                                  #  - variable: NUM has some random variation
                                  #     - higher incentive to start (less initial pause), but less incentive to fulfill
                                  #     - usually better for steady high activity
                                  #     - less engaged user (e.g. early in the game) need lower NUM

EXTINCTION ==>                    #When contingency stops (without user knowing): 
                                  #  - will continue behavior at an ever slower pace
                                  #  - leads to frustration
                                  #  - might be that the reward system changed but user does not know yet

BEHAVIORIAL CONTRAST ==>          #When reward is lesser that it used to be:
                                  #  - leads to frustration
                                  #  - should have a steady increasing rate instead

AVOIDANCE ==>                     #When reward is to prevent a negative thing to happen:
                                  #  - good to keep activity high without introducing new features

INTEREST ==>                      #Reward lose interest over time:
                                  #  - should have several contingencies at same time to keep interest

WHAT TO BUY ==>                   #Progress gate: 
                                  #  - new levels
                                  #  - types:
                                  #     - hard: can only pay
                                  #     - soft: can also spend more time instead
                                  #        - can make it so it feels spending extra time is waste, 
                                  #          e.g. by capping max amount of resources until gate passed, so resource generated during that time is wasted
                                  #Boosters:
                                  #  - new abilities
                                  #  - types:
                                  #     - soft: ephemeral
                                  #     - hard: persistent
                                  #        - can merge hard boosters to make people pay big amount by making them pay several smaller ones
                                  #     - mix: hard if you keep paying, including by merging it into other boosters
                                  #Reward removal:
                                  #  - give reward that user takes for granted 
                                  #  - then later threaten to withdraw because of a given failure, unless payment

SKILL VS MONEY GAME ==>           #Skill game: success is determined by skill
                                  #Money game: money helps winning
                                  #Can slowly transition from skill games to money games by progressively introducing boosters

VIRTUAL CURRENCY ==>              #Hiding real purchase feeling by introducing intermediate virtual currency
