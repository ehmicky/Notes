GOAL ==>                          #Turn JSDoc comments into a TypeScript ambient file
                                  #Not very useful:
                                  #  - --declaration already does it for JavaScript files
                                  #  - ambient file would not be high-quality
                                  #Uses @class|constant|member|callback|function|interface|mixin|module|namespace|typedef|file|event
