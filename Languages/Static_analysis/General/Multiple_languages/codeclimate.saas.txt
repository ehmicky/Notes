CODE CLIMATE ==>              #Static code analysis (JavaScript, Ruby, PHP):
                              #  - Complexity (number of assignments, functions calls, conditions by functions and files)
                              #  - Churn (how often updated)
                              #  - Duplicated code
                              #  - Coverage
                              #  - Syntax problem / bad coding
                              #  - Security vulnerabilities (Rails only)
                              #How:
                              #  - done on GitHub push received webhook
                              #  - also comment on pull requests
                              #  - manual trigger (Refresh icon)
                              #Also:
                              #  - Comparison between branches, and over time. News feed.
                              #  - Can exclude files
                              #  - can open GitHub issues, PivotalTracker's bug issues
                              #Notifications:
                              #  - email, campfire, hipchat, slack, RSS
