CODE CLIMATE ==>              #Static code analysis (JavaScript, Ruby, PHP):
                              #  - Complexity (number of assignments, functions calls, conditions by functions and files)
                              #  - Churn (how often updated)
                              #  - Duplicated code
                              #  - Coverage
                              #  - Syntax problem / bad coding
