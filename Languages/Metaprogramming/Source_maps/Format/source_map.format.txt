VERSION ==>                       #18/11/2013 (revision 3 proposal)

PREVIOUS REVISION ==>             #Previous changes of revision 3:
                                  #  - //@ and /* @ instead of //# and /* #
                                  #  - no sourcesContent
                                  #  - X-SourceMap [S] instead of SourceMap [S]
                                  #Revision 2 and 1 not documented because too different

GOAL ==>                          #Map positions and variable names compiled file <-> source file
                                  #Reason: allowing to debug compiled file using source file
                                  #Can:
                                  #  - be inlined ("inline source map") or a separate file
                                  #  - be concatenated ("index map")
                                  #  - work with multi-stage compilation ("multi-level map")
