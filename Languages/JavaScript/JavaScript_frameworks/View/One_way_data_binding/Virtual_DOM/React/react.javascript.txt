PRINCIPLE ==>                     #Data flow:
                                  #  - one-way direction (parent to children):
                                  #      - communicating with parent: passing a FUNC (e.g. REACTLINK) as props
                                  #  - 'state' is state owned by current RCOMP, 'props' is state owned by a parent
                                  #     - when changing 'state':
                                  #        - current RCOMP gets 'updated'
                                  #        - children get 'updated' (if same RTYPE) or 'unmounted|mounted' (if different RTYPE)
                                  #     - smart vs dumb RCOMP:
                                  #        - smart components / 'containers':
                                  #           - manipulate state:
                                  #              - have 'state', passed to children as props
                                  #              - pass Flux actions callbacks to children
                                  #           - not visual, e.g. no CSS nor DOM
                                  #           - should be as few as possible
                                  #        - dumb / 'presentational' components:
                                  #           - manipulate UI:
                                  #              - no 'state'
                                  #           - reusable, so no dependency (e.g. no Flux actions nor dispatch)
                                  #     - reduce amount of 'state':
                                  #        - not computed|duplicated from other 'state|props'
                                  #           - e.g. getInitialState() should not use props
                                  #        - not complex (e.g. not RELEM)
                                  #     - 'context':
                                  #        - like 'props' but with less typing
                                  #        - should only be used for 'props' that are used everywhere in the app, e.g. current user, design theme, etc.
                                  #        - should use explicit 'props' otherwise
                                  #  - children are owned by the RCOMP that create them:
                                  #     - i.e. in RCOMP.render() -> <RCOMP2>...</RCOMP2>, ... will be 'updated' when current RCOMP is,
                                  #       but not when RCOMP2 is, except if cloned in RCOMP2.render()
                                  #        - will still be correctly 'mounted|unmounted'
                                  #Virtual DOM:
                                  #  - provides abstraction (e.g. can be used on server without real DOM)
                                  #  - allows faster diff algorithm
                                  #  - problem: makes it harder to reach to actual DOM
                                  #JSX: mixing templates into JavaScript because they belong together

GOOD PRACTICES ==>                #  - when passing props down, should explicitely pass props that are consumed, e.g. deconstructing then spreading:
                                  #      let [ VAR, OBJ... ] = this.props;
                                  #      // Use VAR
                                  #      return <ELEM [VAR={VAR}] {...OBJ}>

BAD PRACTICES ==>                 #  - reaching to HTML elements instead of using RELEM|RCOMP abstraction:
                                  #     - e.g. using REF, REACTDOM.findDOMNode()
                                  #  - using RCOMP other than as 'this' in RCOMP methods:
                                  #     - e.g. using REACTDOM.render() return value
                                  #  - shortcircuiting data flow:
                                  #     - RCOMP.forceUpdate()

RDOM ==>                          #Builtin RTYPE mimicking usual HTML.
                                  #Differences are below.

ALLOWED HTML TAGS|ATTRIBUTES ==>  #Whitelisted:
                                  #  - but should cover most standard HTML
                                  #  - custom HTML tags are allowed
                                  #  - custom HTML attributes are allowed if HTML tag name contains '-' or HTML attribute
                                  #    is="..." present

HTML ATTRIBUTES ==>               #  - camelCased, except data-*, aria-*
                                  #  - class -> className, html -> htmlFor
                                  #  - values:
                                  #     - style.CSSPROP VAL (camelCased, except vendor prefix which are titleized)
                                  #     - boolean attributes: must only use BOOL as value
                                  #     - NUM -> NUMpx, except where LENP is not expected
                                  #  - new:

                                  #     - ref|key: see below

DOM EVENTS ==>                    #  - onEvent(REVENT), with REVENT being like EVENT but:
                                  #     - better crossbrowser behavior
                                  #     - more performant (use only one global event listener, then redistribute)
                                  #     - extra properties:
                                  #        - nativeEvent EVENT
                                  #        - isDefaultPrevented|PropagationStopped(): like jQuery
                                  #     - no stopImmediatePropagation()
                                  #     - is deleted after function ends, so async can only use it with:
                                  #        - copying to local variable
                                  #        - or calling REVENT.persist()

FORM CONTROLS ==>                 #Value:
                                  #  - <textarea> children   -> <textarea value>

                                  #HTML attributes:
                                  #  - onChange:
                                  #     - should be used. Like onInput, but with React's behavior for 'value'
                                  #     - for checkboxes|radio buttons, do not call REVENT.preventDefault(),
                                  #       or control will be updated in model but not in UI
                                  #  - value|checked:
                                  #     - sets default value
                                  #     - makes control read-only: can only updated with new render(), usually
                                  #       with this.setState() in onChange event handler
                                  #     - not updated on UI interaction but:
                                  #        - JavaScript value|checked is
                                  #        - if it triggers a new render() with new value|checked, it gets updated like this
                                  #     - if null|undefined (as opposed to ''), does not do anything anymore
                                  #  - defaultValue|Checked: only sets default value
