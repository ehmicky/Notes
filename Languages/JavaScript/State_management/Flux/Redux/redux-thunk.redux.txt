VERSION ==>                       #1.0.2

REDUX.applyMiddleware(REDUXTHUNK) #Makes it possible to dispatch FUNC(DISPATCH, GETSTATE) instead of ACTION:
                                  #  - arguments are STORE.dispatch|getState()
                                  #  - FUNC is evaluated each time is it dispatched.
                                  #  - if FUNC, does not dispatch any ACTION, so FUNC() will need to call DISPATCH (or not)
