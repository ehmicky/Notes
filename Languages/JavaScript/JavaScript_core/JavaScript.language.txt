MAIN PRINCIPLES ==>                             #Case-sensitive. Whitespaces are ignored.
                                                #Type: weak, dynamic, generic, late/duck.

EXECUTION ==>                                   #Each browser has own JavaScript engine, which was in the past interpreted,

EVENT LOOP ==>                                  #Loops:
                                                #  - each event loop loops through [macro]tasks

                                                #  - each microtask is run synchronously

NEW TASKS ==>                                   #Each thread has a single event loop
                                                #  - creates a new thread: process, WebWorker, cross-origin <iframe>
                                                #Macrotasks are created by I/O code, which includes:
                                                #  - setTimeout|Interval|Immediate()
                                                #  - filesystem, network or OS calls
                                                #     - not streams on their own
                                                #  - event handlers triggered by browser interaction.
                                                #     - events triggered directly through JavaScript, which include Node.js EVENTEMITTER, are sync.
                                                #Microtasks are created by:
                                                #  - process.nextTick()
                                                #  - queueMicrotask()
                                                #  - PROMISE.then|catch() callbacks
                                                #  - priority:
                                                #     - first-in first-out
                                                #     - process.nextTick() before other types of microtasks
                                                #        - e.g. if a process.nextTick() create a new process.nextTick(),
                                                #          it will be fired before pending PROMISE microtasks

PERFORMANCE ==>                                 #For Node.js:
                                                #  - minimal time of a macrotask is 1ms.
                                                #    I.e. a macrotask that only does setTimeout(..., 0) will last 1ms
                                                #  - there is no minimal time for a microtask

SINGLE-THREADED ==>                             #Each event loop is single-threaded:
                                                #  - i.e. only one microtask and one macrotask runs at any time
                                                #Resources:
                                                #  - I/O-intensive tasks:
                                                #     - are the slowest
                                                #     - should yield the thread and be woken up on a new macrotask
                                                #     - this is what most I/O functions do by default, i.e. I/O calls are
                                                #       optimally handled
                                                #     - i.e. developer just need to use async I/O functions
                                                #  - CPU-intensive tasks:
                                                #     - will hold the whole thread
                                                #     - if too slow, should spawn a new thread instead
                                                #  - memory consumption:
                                                #     - is very low, because thread and processes is what makes memory go high

ASYNC EXPECTATION ==>                           #Libraries exposing callbacks should trigger them in a new microtask,
                                                #because this what consumers usually expect.
                                                #  - e.g. this would otherwise be problematic:
                                                #     let VAR = FUNC(CALLBACK); VAR.on('start', ...)

THREAD EXIT ==>                                 #Thread exits when the event loop has no more macrotasks
                                                #In a browser, this never happens, as there are always DOM event listeners.
                                                #In Node.js:
                                                #  - this means any of the following will keep the thread running:
                                                #     - process.nextTick(), queueMicrotask(), setTimeout|setInterval()
                                                #     - PROMISE.then|catch() FUNC, await PROMISE
                                                #     - TCPSERVER.ref(), CHILDPROCESS.ref(), and anything higher
                                                #  - some I/O objects expose unref() methods to yield the macrotask

ASYNC STACK TRACE ==>                           #Also called "long stack trace"
                                                #When using async, the callback function does not include stack trace from parent function
                                                #  - because it is processed on a different microtask
                                                #This is missing in:
                                                #  - setTimeout|Interval|Immediate(FUNC), process.nextTick(FUNC), queueMicrotask()
                                                #  - filesystem, network, OS or browser interaction event handlers
                                                #  - new Promise()
                                                #This is not missing when using async|await:
                                                #  - including whn using Promise.*()
                                                #  - supported:
                                                #     - code during|before an await statement: always
                                                #     - code after an await statement: most browsers and Node
