VERSION ==>                       #Standard is called ECMAScript. JavaScript and ActionScript are dialects.
                                  #This doc shows strict mode only

SUPPORT ==>                       #Use this notation for new features:
                                 ~#  - stage 3 proposal
                               NUM#  - introduced by Node NUM.*.*

EXECUTION ==>                     #Each browser has own JavaScript engine, which was in the past interpreted,
                                  #but now is byte-compiled or compiled:

                                  #  - SpiderMonkey (Firefox, MongoDB >=3.2)
                                  #  - JavaScriptCore/SquirrelFish/Nitro (Safari) part of WebKit

EVENT LOOP ==>                    #Loops:
                                  #  - each event loop loops through [macro]tasks
                                  #  - each macrotask loops through microtasks|tick
                                  #  - each microtask is run synchronously

NEW TASKS ==>                     #Each thread has a single event loop
                                  #  - creates a new thread: process, WebWorker, cross-origin <iframe>
                                  #Macrotasks are created by I/O code, which includes:
                                  #  - setTimeout|Interval|Immediate()
                                  #  - filesystem, network or OS calls
                                  #     - not streams on their own
                                  #  - event handlers triggered by browser interaction.
                                  #     - events triggered directly through JavaScript, which include Node.js EVENTEMITTER, are sync.
                                  #Microtasks are created by:
                                  #  - process.nextTick()
                                  #  - queueMicrotask()
                                  #  - PROMISE.then|catch() callbacks
                                  #  - priority:
                                  #     - first-in first-out
                                  #     - process.nextTick() before other types of microtasks
                                  #        - e.g. if a process.nextTick() create a new process.nextTick(),
                                  #          it will be fired before pending PROMISE microtasks

PERFORMANCE ==>                   #For Node.js:
                                  #  - minimal time of a macrotask is 1ms.
                                  #    I.e. a macrotask that only does setTimeout(..., 0) will last 1ms
                                  #  - there is no minimal time for a microtask

SINGLE-THREADED ==>               #Each event loop is single-threaded:
                                  #  - i.e. only one microtask and one macrotask runs at any time
                                  #Resources:
                                  #  - I/O-intensive tasks:
                                  #     - are the slowest
                                  #     - should yield the thread and be woken up on a new macrotask
                                  #     - this is what most I/O functions do by default, i.e. I/O calls are
                                  #       optimally handled
                                  #     - i.e. developer just need to use async I/O functions
                                  #  - CPU-intensive tasks:
                                  #     - will hold the whole thread
                                  #     - if too slow, should spawn a new thread instead
                                  #  - memory consumption:
                                  #     - is very low, because thread and processes is what makes memory go high

ASYNC EXPECTATION ==>             #Libraries exposing callbacks should trigger them in a new microtask,
                                  #because this what consumers usually expect.
                                  #  - e.g. this would otherwise be problematic:
                                  #     let VAR = FUNC(CALLBACK); VAR.on('start', ...)

THREAD EXIT ==>                   #Thread exits when the event loop has no more macrotasks
                                  #In a browser, this never happens, as there are always DOM event listeners.
                                  #In Node.js:
                                  #  - timers methods keep the thread alive
                                  #     - i.e. automatically ref'd
                                  #     - process.nextTick(), queueMicrotask(), setTimeout|setInterval()
                                  #  - PROMISEs do not keep the thread alive by themselves
                                  #     - PROMISE.then|catch() FUNC, await PROMISE
                                  #     - but they do when the PROMISE relies on ref'd logic
                                  #  - any external input is ref'd by Node.js
                                  #     - I/O, processes, network
                                  #  - sometimes ref|unref() methods are exposed to manually control this

ASYNC STACK TRACE ==>             #Also called "long stack trace"
                                  #When using async, the callback function does not include stack trace from parent function
                                  #  - because it is processed on a different microtask
                                  #This is missing in:
                                  #  - setTimeout|Interval|Immediate(FUNC), process.nextTick(FUNC), queueMicrotask()
                                  #  - filesystem, network, OS or browser interaction event handlers
                                  #  - new Promise()
                                  #This is not missing when using async|await:
                                  #  - including whn using Promise.*()
                                  #  - supported:
                                  #     - code during|before an await statement: always
                                  #     - code after an await statement: most browsers and Node

GENERAL ==>                       #  - variable scope is:
                                  #     - "var": FUNC {...}
                                  #     - "let|const": any {...}
                                  #  - any function inherits scope of the function in which it is declared (not called)
                                  #     - inherits by reference, not by value
globalThis                        #Global scope reference
                                  #Otherwise can be in many places (self in WORKER, window in DOM, global in Node.js, this otherwise)

DECLARATION ==>                   #  - using undeclared VAR throws ReferenceError (except with typeof)
                                  #  - using VAR (even if declared in parent scope) declared later in
                                  #    current scope with:
                                  #     - "let|const": throws ReferenceError ("Temporal Dead Zone")
                                  #     - "var": adds an implicit empty declaration before, i.e. will be
                                  #       undefined (variable hoisting)
                                  #     - function FUNC(){}: adds an implicit declaration+assignment before

DECLARING FUNCTIONS ==>           #  - FUNC = function [FUNC2](){}
                                  #     - declared+assigned at runtime (like other variables)
                                  #     - this also covers anonymous function, and void function [FUNC2](){}
                                  #     - Using "FUNC2":
                                  #        - equivalent of doing let FUNC2 = function(){} at the beginning of
                                  #          the same function
                                  #        - allow recursion to reference themselves without risk of parent
                                  #          scope to reassign FUNC2
                                  #  - function FUNC2(){}:
                                  #     - declared+assigned at parsetime
                                  #        - i.e. equivalent of doing let FUNC2 = function () {} at {...} scope
                                  #          beginning
                                  #  - new Function(...): child of global scope

MEMORY MANAGEMENT ==>             #Garbage collection:
                                  #  - use tracing, i.e. no problem with reference cycles
                                  #  - root objects are global variables
                                  #  - closures carry references to their parent scope, but only of the
                                  #    references they use
                                  #     - this might be problematic when closures are returned, i.e. go up the
                                  #       stack, extending their parent scope lifetime
                                  #Memory leak happens with combination of variables being:
                                  #  - big, e.g.:

                                  #     - big objects
                                  #     - raw data returned from server

                                  #     - attached to top/long-lived SCOPEs, e.g. global variables, e.g.:
                                  #        - long-lived DOM elements
