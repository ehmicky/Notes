FINGERPRINTING ==>                #Creating a device|machine ID using its capabilities instead of usual state mechanisms (e.g. cookies)

DIVERSITY ==>                     #Number of possible state combinations used in ID
                                  #  - measured in bits of entropy
                                  #  - i.e. how much it distinguish one machine from another
                                  #Also, whether possible state combinations are evenly distributed

STABILITY ==>                     #Whether ID does not change over time
                                  #Inversely corrolated to diversity
                                  #  - however, if only some of the combinations change, can identity previous ID and update it
                                  #    instead of creating a new one

PASSIVE ==>                       #Capability that is read-only, i.e. cannot be changed by users
                                  #As opposed to active

PROTECTION ==>                    #For each capability, either:
                                  #  - do not send
                                  #  - randomize

LIST OF CAPABILITIES ==>          #Browser:
                                  #  - active extensions, e.g. AdBlock
                                  #HTTP:

                                  #  - DNT [C]
                                  #  - Enrichment (headers added by network proxies)
                                  #JavaScript:
                                  #  - DATE.getTimezoneOffset()
                                  #  - supported features
                                  #DOM:
                                  #  - CANVAS: draw 2D|3D to see variations due to different GPU
                                  #  - NAVIGATOR: plugins, platform, cookieEnabled
                                  #  - SCREEN: height, width, colorDepth
                                  #  - supported features, e.g. localStorage|sessionStorage
                                  #NTP:
                                  #  - clock skew: small sync difference (in ms)
                                  #TCP/IP:
                                  #  - configuration
                                  #     - initial packet size, initial TTL, window size, max segment size,
