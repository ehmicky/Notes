TRACKING ==>                      #Gives personal information without consent
                                  #Akin to forced negotiation (i.e. weakens one side of the negotation)

SANCTIONING ==>                   #Whether tracking is user controlled, easy to detect, and based on standards
                                  #As opposed to fingerprinting, supercookies, etc.
                                  #Standard: W3C TAG "Unsanctioned tracking"
