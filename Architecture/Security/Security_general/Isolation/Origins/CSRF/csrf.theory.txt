CSRF ==>                          #Cross-Site Request Forgery
                                  #Also called XSRF
                                  #An ORIGIN performs command on another ORIGIN, using its cached confidential data (e.g. cookies)
                                  #Preventions:
                                  #  - SOP
                                  #  - not keeping confidential data client-side
                                  #     - e.g. never caching login credentials
                                  #  - CSRF token
                                  #  - SameSite cookies (see its doc)

LOGIN CSRF ==>                    #CSRF accessing authentication data

CSRF URL ==>                      #CSRF with a GET request, i.e. can be triggered from clicking a URL
                                  #Prevention: no side-effects with GET

CSRF TOKEN ==>                    #Nonce sent by server to client to authenticate next request[s]
                                  #Also called synchronizer|challenge token
                                  #This reduces CSRF risk since attacker must know CSRF token too
X-CSRF-Token: STR [S]
X-XSRF-Token: STR [S]             #Common name for CSRF token
