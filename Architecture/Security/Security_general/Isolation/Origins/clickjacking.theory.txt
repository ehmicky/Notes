CLICKJACKING ==>                  #CSRF using an <iframe|frame|object|embed> with different ORIGIN
                                  #and make users click in it, believe it to be same ORIGIN
                                  #Also called UI redressing

CSP ==>                           #'frame-ancestors' (see its doc) prevents clickjacking

X-Frame-Options: VAL [S]          #Prevents clickjacking
                                  #Ask client to allow putting response in an <iframe|frame|object|embed>:
                                  #  - DENY: never
                                  #  - SAMEORIGIN: only if parent has same origin
                                  #  - ALLOW-FROM DOMAIN: only if top-level from DOMAIN (ignored by most browsers)
                                  #RFC 7034
                                  #Deprecated: prefer CSP 'frame-ancestors'

WINDOW.top === WINDOW             #Can be used for confirmation to prevent clickjacking
WINDOW.confirm()                  #Same, since popup cannot be framed
