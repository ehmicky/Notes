FEATURE CREEP ==>                 #Also called "featurism"
                                  #Too much flexibility vs not enough user-friendliness
                                  #If it dramatically increase code size, complexity or resource consumption, called "software bloat"

DEAD-END ==>                      #Also called "Kevorkian component" or "COTS" (Commercial Off-the-shelf)
                                  #Customizing a tool/library that is not designed to be customized
                                  #Done for increased flexibility, but comes with high maintainance problem
MONKEY PATCHING ==>               #Dead-end when the modification is performed by modifying tool/library code runtime
                                  #Comes with additional problems:
                                  #  - possible conflicts between monkey patches
                                  #  - changing the tool's interface, although the interface is used by other modules
