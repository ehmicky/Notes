EXTENSIBILITY ==>                 #Ease to add new features, for developers
MODIFIABILITY ==>                 #Same but for users instead.
                                  #If users are developers (e.g. library), it might be corrolated


PASSING RUNNING CODE ==>          #Can pass running code (as opposed to data) to an interface by:
                                  #  - modifying interface code directly: no abstraction, and only possible if access to interface code
                                  #  - passing functions as arguments ("callbacks"): simpler
                                  #  - event|hooks (see modularity doc)
