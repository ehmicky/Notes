SOFTWARE ROT ==>                  #Decreased maintainability due to time passing by or new code

LAVA FLOW / DEAD CODE ==>         #Antipattern: unused code
                                  #Increase code complexity, and decrease efficiency
                                  #Preventing it:
                                  #  - not implementing things that "might one day"
                                  #  - spend enough time on design before implementation

BOAT ANCHOR ==>                   #Tool or library that:
                                  #  - was acquired because originally though useful
                                  #     - including by non-technical management
                                  #  - but actually is not
                                  #Comes as a maintainance burden

OLD DEPENDENCIES ==>              #Prevents other dependencies from being updated, or new features

LEGACY SYSTEM ==>                 #System that exhibits software rot
