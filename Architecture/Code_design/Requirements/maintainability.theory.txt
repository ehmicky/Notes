MAINTAINABILITY ==>               #Ease to manage by developers (i.e. complexity), i.e. ease to:
                                  #  - operability: keep on offering same features
                                  #     - transferability: operability for new developers
                                  #  - extensibility: offer new features
                                  #     - portability: support new environments
                                  #     - reusability
                                  #  - scalability: increase|decrease demand
                                  #Opposite is "brittleness"

MODULARITY & ABSTRACTION ==>      #Usually coupled, increase maintainability:
                                  #  - modularity: multiple contexts inside same logic (incoherence) -> move complexity in-between, i.e. horizontal
                                  #  - abstraction: multiple contexts using common logic -> move complexity downstream, i.e. vertical
                                  #See their doc

REFACTORING ==>                   #Increasing maintainability by modifying code design|architecture
