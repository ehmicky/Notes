BINARY SEARCH ==>                 #Search within a sorted array that:
                                  #  - check if the median element is <= or >= than searched element
                                  #  - recurse over the lower|upper half
                                  #Also called "half-interval|logarithmic search" or "binary chop"

                                  #Variants (micro-optimizations):
                                  #  - "uniform binary search":
                                  #     - when array size is static
                                  #     - pre-compute integer offsets for each step and store in a lookup table,
                                  #       as opposed to calculate the middle index using the upper and lower bounds
                                  #  - "fibonacci search":
                                  #     - instead of checking the median element, check the highest index that is a Fibonnaci
                                  #       number
                                  #     - goal: on CPUs where << * or / is slow, as opposed to +

DATA STRUCTURES ==>               #  - search tree: as a tree
                                  #  - skip list: as a list of linked lists
                                  #  - trie: when values are arrays
                                  #  - rope, conc tree: when values are elements of a single array, accessed by index
                                  #See below for more information

EXPONENTIAL SEARCH ==>            #Similar to the binary search but instead with an exponentially increasing increment.
                                  #Also called "doubling|galloping|Struzik search".
                                  #E.g. with factor 2:
                                  #  - check index 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. until >= value
                                  #  - then recurse on the sub-array

                                  #  - streaming algorithm: can be performed on array with unknown|infinite size
                                  #  - faster if element is at beginning, slower if at end
                                  #  - better locality of reference
                                  #Variant:
                                  #  - perform successive searches with decreasing increments
                                  #  - e.g. index **= 3 then index **= 2 then index *= 2
                                  #  - same time|space complexity
                                  #  - faster for elements at end, but slower at beginning

INTERPOLATION SEARCH ==>          #Similar to the binary search but:
                                  #  - instead of picking the median, pick the most likely index, proportionally to the value
                                  #     - i.e. instead of index at 50%, use index at (value - lower) / (upper - lower)
                                  #  - "proportional" is according to the probability distribution of the values
                                  #     - i.e. the calculation above is when distribution is uniform
                                  #Time complexity:
                                  #  - best: O(log log n) when values are following the probability distribution
                                  #  - worst: O(n)
                                  #Goal: faster when probability distribution of values is known

FRACTIONAL CASCADING ==>          #Data structure to perform a sequence of binary searches on k different arrays.
                                  #Each array:
                                  #  - precomputes the position of each of its value if they were inserted in the next array, i.e.:
                                  #     - this can be used as fingers to speed up looking up the next array
                                  #     - each extra array search performs in O(1)
                                  #  - contains half of the values (every odd index) of the next array
                                  #     - i.e. position of original value in original array must be stored first
                                  #     - this is built from last to first, i.e. it cascades
                                  #     - reason: otherwise if next array has very different range of values, the finger found
                                  #       in current array might not be helpful at all
                                  #Time complexity: O(log n + k) instead of O(k * log n/k)
                                  #Space complexity: O(n) because each array has double size, and contains two extra indices
                                  #Variants:
                                  #  - "catalog graph":
                                  #     - make each array point to several "next arrays" instead
                                  #     - i.e. arrays become nodes of a directed graph
                                  #     - goal: when order of sequence of binary searches is dynamic
                                  #  - "dynamic fractional cascading":
                                  #     - when data structure is dynamic, i.e. insert|delete are allowed
