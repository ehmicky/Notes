SEARCH TREE ==>                   #Arborescence where nodes are ordered: left children < parent < right children.
                                  #Optimized for:
                                  #  - search
                                  #  - serial access in sorted order
                                  #Time complexity:
                                  #  - search: O(m/2*logₘ n) where m is outdegree
                                  #  - insert|delete:
                                  #     - like search
                                  #     - first search of it, then perform constant-time insert|delete
                                  #  - tree must be balanced, otherwise:
                                  #     - height will average ᵐ√order, and complexity O(ᵐ√n)
                                  #     - can even be O(n) if search tree degenerates into a line graph
                                  #Values can be stored either on each node or only on leaves
                                  #Pros:
                                  #  - O(log n) operations (search|insert|delete)
                                  #  - automatically ordered, good for iteration
                                  #  - persistent data structure
                                  #  - recursive data structure
                                  #Cons:
                                  #  - fairly "average" data structure: space|time complexity is neither best nor wosrt
                                  #  - less time efficient if small number of items

BINARY SEARCH TREE (BST) ==>      #Search tree where outdegree = 2
                                  #Search is "binary search".

                                  #  - make each sibling point to next sibling
                                  #  - only keep edge from parent to first child
                                  #Also called "child-sibling representation", "doubly-chained tree", "filial-heir chain"
                                  #Consequences:
                                  #  - pro: result is a binary tree, which is more space efficient than a k-ary tree
                                  #     - i.e. not knowing each vertex's outdegree requires dynamic arrays, which require
                                  #       extra pointers and dope vectors
                                  #  - con: siblings must be accessed in serial access not random access

                                  #  - better when nodes are read|write sequentially
                                  #     - i.e. when siblings nodes are usually read|write together
                                  #     - e.g. a file's blocks
                                  #  - instead of O(log₂ n), performs in O(m/2*logₘ n) to find node
                                  #    (which is worst), but then iterating|inserting|deleting siblings is faster

                                  #     - transfer ("rotation") or "merge|split" between siblings

                                  #  - can be done either:
                                  #     - between operations
                                  #     - during operation, as nodes are being visited

B+ TREE ==>                       #B-tree where:
                                  #  - values are stored only on leaves

                                  #  - do a random pick among all possible trees after insertion of each
                                  #    permutation of the nodes.
                                  #For a binary search tree, in average, depth will be:

                                  #  - self-balanced by making it a random search tree (using random KEYs)

                                  #     - perform tree rotations on that node and its right child until that node has no children
                                  #     - delete that node
                                  #  - split:
                                  #     - insert a node with VAL where split occurs and KEY being highest so that node becomes

                                  #     - then remove that node, splitting tree

                                  #     - then insert a node with VAL2 in-between, and KEY being lowest so that rotations

                                  #     - then remove that node

                                  #     - often represented as a tree with outdegree 3 where:
                                  #        - left and right children are siblings (i.e. the binary search subtree)
                                  #        - middle child is actual child (i.e. the trie supertree)
                                  #  - static array:
                                  #     - with every possible combination, filled with null pointers when no child
                                  #     - O(1) lookup time but O(m) space requirement, where m is number of combinations
                                  #     - "alphabet reduction":
                                  #        - reducing number of combinations, e.g. nibble-wise (16) instead of byte-wise (256)
                                  #        - con: increases tree height
                                  #     - "array mapped trie": when using "array bit mapping" (see its doc)
                                  #        - "concurrent trie"/"ctrie":
                                  #           - using a 32 bits map and a compare-and-swap atomic CPU instruction, so that
                                  #             trie can be thread-safe and lock-free
                                  #Operations:
                                  #  - finding nodes by key prefix

RADIX TREE ==>                    #Trie where nodes can store several key items, as opposed to just one.
                                  #Goal:
                                  #  - more space efficient
                                  #  - more time efficient on reads
                                  #Cons:
                                  #  - less space efficient if high density
                                  #  - less time efficient on writes
                                  #Operations:
                                  #  - insertion: during initial traversal, if there is a partially matching child, split it
                                  #  - deletion: after deletion, merge single-child nodes to their child

DAFSA ==>                         #DAFSA (see state doc) can used to represent tries in a more space efficient way.
                                  #As opposed to normal representation:
                                  #  - simple cycles (but not directed ones) are allowed
                                  #  - i.e. nodes can share multiple parents as long as it does not introduce directed cycles
                                  #  - i.e. space efficient when many common suffixes

BURST TRIE ==>                    #Trie ("access trie") where leaves ("burst") are another data structure ("burst containers").
                                  #Goal:
                                  #  - using time|space efficiency of trie where prefixes are shared
                                  #  - while using time|space efficiency of other data structures where suffixes are unique
                                  #Common burst containers: list, search tree.
                                  #Different strategies on when burst should start:
                                  #  - max size of burst containers
                                  #  - max average number of operations on burst container
