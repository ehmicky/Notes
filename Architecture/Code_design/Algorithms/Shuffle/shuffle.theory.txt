                                  #     - extract random input element, append to output, then put last input element in its place, then repeat

                                  #     - extract random input element, insert to output at random position, then repeat
                                  #  - swap random input element with another random input element among the following ones or itself, then repeat
                                  #  - "Sattolo cycle":
                                  #     - swap random input element with another random input element among the following ones excluding itself,
