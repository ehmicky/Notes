ENUMS ==>                         #Type whose:
                                  #  - key is among a set of possible exclusive keys
                                  #  - value is unspecified to the user
                                  #     - the compiler/interpreter usually represents it using either:
                                  #        - a compact solution, e.g. bitstring
                                  #        - a simple solution, e.g. same as key
                                  #Enums can be:
                                  #  - either exclusive or not, in which case they can or'd bitwise ("flags")
                                  #  - either ordered or not
                                  #They are an evolution over just using another type (integer or string) with exclusive values
                                  #to simulate that purpose:
                                  #  - more self-documenting
                                  #  - more efficient representation
                                  #  - restrict possible operations
                                  #  - enforce stricter typing

UNIT TYPE ==>                     #Enum with single value.
                                  #Enums can also be thought as union of unit types.
                                  #Examples: null and undefined in JavaScript
