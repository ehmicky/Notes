BOOLEAN ==>                       #Conceptually an enum with false and true, with logic operations
                                  #When represented as number, often use 0 and 1

TRILEAN ==>                       #Also called ternary|trinary logic
                                  #Add an undeterminate|unknown third value
                                  #Operations:
                                  #  - not unkown -> unknown
                                  #  - unkown and true|unknown -> unknown
                                  #  - unkown and false -> false

                                  #When represented as number, often use -1|0|1 or 0|2|1 for false|unknown|true
