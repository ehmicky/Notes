STRUCTURE ==>                     #One section per release:
                                  #  - including not released yet
                                  #  - reverse chronological
                                  #  - containing:
                                  #     - release number
                                  #     - date YYYY-MM-DD
                                  #     - type, e.g.:
                                  #        - added, changed, removed, deprecated, fixed, security

CONTENT ==>                       #  - easy to understand without knowing the code
                                  #  - should mention semver is used
                                  #  - do not forget deprecations

FORMAT ==>                        #  - markdown
                                  #  - named CHANGELOG.md

ALTERNATIVE ==>                   #  - mailing list
