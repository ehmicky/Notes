DEPENDENCY HELL ==>               #Generic word for poor installability

MANUAL RESOLUTION ==>             #When user must install each level of the dependency chain manually
                                  #Solution: package manager

CONFLICTING DEPENDENCIES ==>      #When two dependencies depend on two different versions of same dependency
                                  #Also called "diamond dependency"
                                  #Solutions:
                                  #  - looser versions requirement (e.g. using ^ or ~ with npm) (opposite is "version lock")
                                  #  - allowing dependencies to have different copies of same dependency (e.g. what npm does)

CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES ==>         #Two circular dependencies must be upgrade at same time, because each require a newer version
                                  #of the other.
                                  #Solution: separating download step and run step

VERSION PROMISCUITY ==>           #Upgrading a dependencies introduces breaking changes.
                                  #Solution: versioning scheme

LOTS OF DEPENDENCIES ==>          #Make installation slow
                                  ##Also:
                                  #  - require lots of memory
                                  #  - less portable
                                  #  - more prone to security vulnerability
                                  #  - more complex
                                  #Solution: breaking down system into smaller modules

                                  #  - no leading zero
                                  #  - no releasing same version twice
                                  #     - including when a new release is done because previous one did not respect semver
