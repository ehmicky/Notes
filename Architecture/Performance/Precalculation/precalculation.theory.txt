SPECULATIVE EXECUTION ==>         #Precalculating something that is not 100% sure to be needed
                                  #Example: predictive execution in CPU pipelining

LOOKUP TABLE ==>                  #Precalculating an operation and storing results in an associative array,
                                  #so accessing it is constant time
                                  #Also called "sparse table"

PREFETCHING ==>                   #Precalculating IO/network request

OBJECT POOL ==>                   #Efficient initialization (when it is costly):
                                  #  - pool creates objects in advance
                                  #  - new objects:
                                  #     - are taken from the pool
                                  #     - if not created yet, creates it
                                  #        - there can be a pool size limit ("high water mark")
                                  #  - destroyed objects are returned to the pool for reuse
                                  #     - pool must reset object
                                  #     - if destroyed objects are not returned, this will create starvation

MEMORY POOL ==>                   #Like object pool but for memory allocation
