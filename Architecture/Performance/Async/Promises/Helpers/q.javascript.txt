VERSION ==>                       #Node module (1.0.1)
                                 ##Differences with 2.0 are marked like this (many breaks)
                                  #Used for promises/deferred:
                                  #  - it is a series of chains of callbacks fired sequentially ("resolved"):
                                  #     - callbacks defined in a syntactic chain are fired together, other chains are fired
                                  #       in parallel, e.g. PROMISE.then(FUNC1a).then(FUNC2a); PROMISE.then(FUNC3a): FUNC1a
                                  #       and FUNC3a are fired together, then FUNC2a.
                                  #     - once the chain has been fully resolved (meaning either accepted|rejected), the chain
                                  #       can't be used. This is not the case for notifications.
                                  #     - "next resolution": when a chain depends the resolution of another chain (state and
                                  #       state value), it is always depending only of the next chain part resolution, not the
                                  #       full resolution.
                                  #       But if other chain is already fully resolved, take its final state.
                                  #  - each part of the chain is:
                                  #     - either a FUNC1, a FUNC2 or a FUNC3 according to the "state": accepted, rejected or
                                  #       notified
                                 ##     - FUNC3 are deprecated
                                  #     - associated with a state value (argument to FUNC)
                                  #  - the next state and state value depend on the current part FUNC:
                                  #     - when returning a VAL, state is accepted with VAL for FUNC1|2 and notified with VAL
                                  #       with FUNC3
                                  #       If nothing is returned nor thrown, it is like returning undefined
                                  #     - when throwing a VAL, state is rejected with VAL for FUNC1|2.
                                  #       However, for FUNC3, exceptions are just propagated.
                                  #     - when returning a PROMISE, chain stops, and is resolved with same state and state
                                  #       value as PROMISE "next resolution". The two chains then go their own ways.
                                  #     - default FUNC (when null|undefined) passes the same state and state value to the next
                                  #       part of the chain
                                  #  - Promises are a subpart of deferred:
                                  #     - deferred deal with firing the state, promise to register callbacks.
                                  #     - only promises are usually given to clients, encapsulating deferreds.
                                  #Async:
                                  #  - Callbacks are async., i.e. always return after end of current stack.
                                  #    This means it's possible to register callbacks after triggering a callback chain,
                                  #    if it's in the same code.
                                  #  - Goal: in async. code, cleaner than using callbacks and try/catch blocks.
                                  #Error handling:
                                  #  - throwing an exception does not propagate it in a FUNC1|2 (but does in a FUNC3). Instead
                                  #    it rejects the state with the exception as state value.
                                  #  - however, the last part of the chain should not silent exception: use PROMISE.done() here
                                  #  - exceptions propagated from PROMISE.done() can be caught with Q.onerror = FUNC(ERROR)
