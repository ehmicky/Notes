ALTERNATIVES ==>        #  - p-is-promise (preferred):
                        #     - faster
                        #     - checks for both `then()` and `catch()`
                        #  - is-promise: very similar

VERSION ==>             #4.0.0

P-IS-PROMISE(VAL)->BOOL #Return true if OBJ|FUNC with both `then()` and `catch()` methods
                        #Note: in JavaScript, only `then()` is needed to be PROMISABLE
                        #Checks "instanceof Promise" first, for better performance.
