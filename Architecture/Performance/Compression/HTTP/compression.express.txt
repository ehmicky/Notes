VERSION ==>                   #1.7.4

COMPRESSION([OPTS])->MDWR     #Express MIDWR that compresses RES:
                              #  - according to Accept-Encoding: identity|gzip|deflate [C] (using ACCEPTS, see its doc)
                              #  - sets Vary: Accept-Encoding [S]
                              #  - sets Content-Encoding: gzip|deflate [S]
                              #  - removes Content-Length [S], which sets Transfer-Encoding: chunked [S]
                              #  - does not compress if Cache-Control: no-transform [C]
                              #Do so by monkey-patching underlying RES.write|end|flush(), using ZLIB.createGzip|Deflate()
                              #OPTS:
                              #  - threshold NUM (def: "1kb"): only compress if larger than that (uses BYTES, see its doc)
                              #  - filter FUNC(REQ, RES)->BOOL:
                              #     - only compress if returns true.
                              #     - by def. uses COMPRESSIBLE(MIME) (see its doc)
