TRADEOFF SPEED/EFFICIENCY ==>     #Usually:
                                  #  - tradeoff efficiency (compression ratio) vs speed vs memory usage
                                  #     - fast usually corrolated wituh low memory usage
                                  #  - targetted at specific file type
                                  #For the following free algos:
                                  #  - 7-zip
                                  #  - RAR
                                  #  - tar + gunzip
                                  #  - tar + bzip2
                                  #  - lha
                                  #  - Zip
                                  #  - ZPaq
                                  #Best ratios, with best efficiency on top, and fastest on bottom:
                                  #  - Zpaq:
                                  #     - espcially text and images
                                  #     - very slow and high RAM. Requires C++ library (libzpaq)
                                  #  - 7-Zip
                                  #  - tar + gunzip

FEATURES ==>                      #Beyond tradeoff speed/efficiency:
                                  #  - cryptography
                                  #  - metadata (e.g. comments)
