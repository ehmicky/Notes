 ->FUNC                           #  - additional calls within that time cancels the previous call and resets the delay
                                  #     - even if arguments differ
                                  #  - all calls return undefined

                                  #  - additional calls still reset the delay
                                  #  - first call returns its value, additional calls return most recently returned one
                                  #  - if OPTS.after false (def: true), additional calls are ignored, except for resetting the delay
