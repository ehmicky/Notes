Memory management:
  - [de]allocating memory for variables values
  - can be:
     - manual: more verbose and error-prone, but more resource-efficient
     - automatic (garbage collection): higher-level and simpler, but costs resources

Program memory:
  - stack: local memory [de]allocated as the stack [un]folds, e.g. as function scopes go
  - heap: global memory

Garbage:
  - syntactic: variable that cannot be used, e.g. out of scope
  - semantic: variable that will not be used, e.g. whether it will be used or not is decided runtime

Memory leak:
  - increasing garbage over time
