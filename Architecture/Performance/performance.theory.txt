                                  #     - each operations uses that credit, depending on its complexity
                                  #     - must ensure current credit always above 0
                                  #  - "potential method":
                                  #     - each operation adds cost related to how much disorder it introduces
                                  #     - e.g. for array geometric expansions, getting closer to upper limit introduces
                                  #       disorder

IN-PLACE ALGORITHM ==>            #Algorithm with space complexity O(log n) or less:

                                  #  - constant amount of auxiliary data can be used though,
                                  #    or logarithmic one (e.g. array size pointer has a logarithmic number of bits)
                                  #Opposite is "out-of-place" or "not-in-place"

SPACE-TIME TRADEOFF ==>           #Also called "time-memory tradeoff":
                                  #  - time complexity can often be reduced by increasing space complexity, e.g. precalculation
                                  #  - space complexity can often be reduced by increasing time complexity, e.g. compression

COMPLEXITY TRADEOFF ==>           #Decreasing time complexity usually decreases maintainability

LOCALITY OF REFERENCE ==>         #Information close to each other.
                                  #Also called "principle of locality"
                                  #Can be:
                                  #  - "temporal": over time
                                  #  - "spatial": over space
                                  #     - "memory": over memory
                                  #     - "branch": over branches, i.e. source code
                                  #     - "equidistant": when spatial locality of reference leads to time locality of
                                  #       reference, since information close to each other is more likely to be used at once
                                  #High locality of reference leads to predicting information use pattern for:
                                  #  - information reuse:
                                  #     - caching (see its doc): temporal
                                  #     - compression (see its doc): spatial
                                  #  - idleness reduction:
                                  #     - parallelism (see its doc): increasing current work
                                  #     - throttling: decreasing current work
                                  #     - precalculation (see its doc): move work to future
                                  #     - lazy calculation: move work to past

DATA-ORIENTED DESIGN ==>          #Organizing code to optimize locality of reference and optimize CPU cache re-use.
                                  #Often opposed to OOP which often leads to poor locality of reference because subclassing
                                  #inherits logic and data that is not always used.
                                  #Often uses records of AoS (see aggregate theory)

MEMORY ACCESS PATTERN ==>         #How information is accessed in time.
                                  #The locality of reference depends on the memory access pattern.
                                  #It also affects how parallelism should be performed.
                                  #Can be:
                                  #  - "sequential": increment of 1
                                  #  - "strided": increment of x
                                  #  - "random"
                                  #  - "scatter": sequential reads, random writes
                                  #  - "gather": random reads, sequential writes
                                  #  - "nearest neighbor": nearest nodes from a graph

FLYWEIGHT ==>                     #Also called "hash consing" or (for string constants|symbols) "string interning"
                                  #Refactoring information used in several places (i.e. duplicated, denormalized) to a single place (i.e. normalized):
                                  #  - i.e. using reference to single place ("flyweight"), instead of several copies
                                  #     - "reference" can be language-level (e.g. VAR& in C++) or application-level (e.g. hash table)
                                  #  - flyweight can be shared:
                                  #     - inside each object (i.e. as member)
                                  #     - outside each object (e.g. as function arguments)
                                  #Pros:
                                  #  - more memory efficient
                                  #  - fast to compare equal value, i.e. can compare reference instead of value
                                  #Cons:
                                  #  - less granularity
