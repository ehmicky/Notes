To do:
  - upgrade Node 11.0.0
  - logging/monitoring:
     - request logging:
        - improve information logged to console transport
           - colorize it better
           - pad it better
        - structured logs:
           - add as much information as possible, while trimming body, etc.
           - should include REQ.country
           - send them to either a dashboard or MongoDB
              - potentially remove Sentry, or at least reconfigure it
              - move getCommitHash() outside of config.js
     - error handling:
        - rationalize error types (errors.json)
        - response error on input validation is now on `ERROR.data.message` instead of `ERROR.messages`
           - client needs to change accordingly
        - fix API documentation for errors
        - run migrations on stage/production
     - add more Redash queries to check for data integrity (e.g. slugs are ok)
        - setup alerts
  - remove `null` for `Sheet.description`, `Post.description` and `Metrics.description`
  - upgrade helmet
  - https://trello.com/c/QRQiUJAB/174-individual-ratings-do-not-reflect-the-proper-value-when-admin-sets-a-custom-rating
  - Sheets v2:
     - run data migration on production
     - when front-end ready:
        - should try each possible `source` with a Sheet that has all possible ICOs
  - Prism:
     - abstract common logic into shared repository, and use that
  - on `Sheet|Post.description` create|update: HTML sanitization
     - run against current posts to make sure it does not modify them
  - on-going: tests, API documentation and refactoring for `/icos` endpoints
     - should sanitize ICO private notes' HTML
  - Feed:
     - current Feed vs Post|Sheet division is not right:
        - not being able to filter|sort by Feed.content.* or Post|Sheet.feedItem.* is too restrictive, e.g.:
           - fetch popular posts for a given ICO
           - Feed text search on Post description
           - do not show unlisted/private Posts|Sheets in `GET /posts|sheets`
     - do not populate `Post.icos[*].ico` on `GET /posts` (but do it on `GET /posts/:id`)
        - need to do client changes as well
     - fix `populateMany()` helper so that it preserves sorting order
        - fix the places that use it and currently have to re-sort
     - allow filtering feed by ICO
  - `Sheet` automatic adding feature
     - should perform database migrations to re-actively do it on current users
  - Feed text search
  - `ico owner` role:
     - on user creation, `User.roles` should default to an empty array
     - when an ICO is requested, its owner gets the `User.roles` `ICO_OWNER` (unless already one)
     - when an ICO is deleted, its owner loses the `User.roles` `ICO_OWNER`
     - front-end should not use `ICO_OWNER` role in any fashion at the moment, i.e. those should be removed
     - current users should be migrated to display the correct `User.roles` depending on whether they own an ICO or not
  - fix deleted ICOs still showing up: https://trello.com/c/rQuTpeyV/86-deleted-icos-are-still-available-in-the-ico-details-page-url. Proposal:
     - `ICO.state` can be set to `draft`, `public`, `hidden` or `deleted` with `PUT /icos/:icoId`
        - when an `ICO` is created, `ICO.state` defaults to `draft`
        - it is eventually published by setting `ICO.state` to `public`
        - it can then be deleted or hidden by setting `ICO.state` to `deleted|hidden`
     - updating `ICO.state` can only be done by Admins
        - ICO owners can make an ICO edit request though
     - neither the `ICO` nor any of its related data is never removed from the database.
     - modifying an ICO (`PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`) should return `400` (i.e. read-only) if `ICO.state` is `deleted`. Other `ICO.state` do not have that restriction
     - `GET` a deleted/draft/hidden `ICO` by ID/slug should return `404` unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - `GET` several `ICO`s should skip deleted/draft/hidden ICOs unless `?state=["draft|public|hidden|deleted", ...]` query parameter is used (default: `['public']`)
     - this is for any ICOs requests, whether being top-level on `/icos` or as a nested attribute within another route/model.
     - When it comes to the front-end, it should use `?state` parameter depending on the use case:
        - ICO lists vs calendar vs main listing page vs etc.
        - front-end app vs admin app
        - etc. (edited)
  - add API documentation about `isAdmin` check on `/tags`, `/metrics` `/users` endpoints
  - why is `GET /users?q` test randomly failing? Seems like index is not properly built by Mongoose
  - slugs:
     - use slugify from Sindresorhus instead
     - generate new slugs on database
  - Anton goodbye list
  - learn latest MongoDB and upgrade it
  - finish branch feature/errors_v2
     - also fix errors in API documentation
     - do not report local errors to Sentry, only stage and production
  - improve body parsing:
     - e.g. errors (payload too large) trigger 500
  - blog post about test-openapi
  - integration testing
     - also test middleware (not only endpoints)
  - refactoring:
     - make status codes more consistent and hide behind a common interface
     - refactor authentication to simplify it
  - migrations:
     - check production database matches our data model (perform live queries to fix it otherwise)
     - automated system that syncs staging database with production database
     - system to perform and test migrations against production database
  - add a model layer between controller and Mongoose:
     - provide caching invalidation functionality
     - provide ICO slug update functionality
     - make any DELETE flag the model as deleted, but not removed from database
  - upgrade node.bcrypt.js to fix security vulnerability (when they release a version)
  - Gulp buildwatch crashes (does not watch anymore) after the first OpenAPI error
  - switch Jasmine to Jest, like in front-end
  - add Flow
  - RSS/Atom
  - generate client SDKs from OpenAPI: JavaScript, Bash, others
  - replace current dependency REQUEST by CROSS-FETCH
  - lint-staged currently does not allow committing only half of a file
  - use declarative way (with JSON-SCHEMA-MOCKER) instead of current approach for populating scripts
  - create fake|test database from OpenAPI:
     - can maybe specify in OpenAPI if a specific type of data is prefered
        - e.g. at least one user should be admin
        - can use faker, etc.
     - can replace populating scripts
     - can be merged with the test populating task at beginning of integration tests
  - use JSON schema instead of joi:
     - probably using SWAY.validateRequest|Response()
     - first use JSON schema during integration testing, then suggesting merging
        - maybe use enjoi as transition
     - possible advantages of JSON schemas:
        - declarative:
           - can be communicated to clients so they can validate before sending to APIs
              - there are even library to generate <form> and <input>
           - schema is data not code, i.e. easier to manipulate for other purpose
              - e.g. can be used for auto-documentation
        - we do not want to be loose on validation with sanitization, but fail hard instead
           - joi is built as sanitizer, e.g. every validation creates a deep copy
        - not JavaScript-specific
        - https://github.com/icebob/validator-benchmark
     - also validate response
     - also parse request parameters
  - replace server-driven populating by client-driven populating:
     - first refactor populating so that each route declaratively specify which models to populate instead of
       doing it imperatively
     - then let clients decide it with a query parameter instead of declaring it on the routes
     - same for:
       - filter
       - aggregation
       - pagination
       - sorting
       - population
  - deleting users
  - generate Mongoose models from OpenAPI specification
  - add GraphQL:
     - swagger-to-graphql would allow automating it while still supporting REST
     - I estimated it at 2 days of work
  - other possible uses of OpenAPI:
     - server-side routing
     - web automation
     - mock server
  - yamllint

To do (front-end app):
  - keep .editorconfig in sync with back-end one

Ideas:
  - gamification:
     - simple overall/aggregate ranking number
     - widget/badges showing "certified by"
     - rankings, "best of the week"
     - think of potentialpark
