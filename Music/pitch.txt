Octave:
  - ratio of 2 between 2 frequencies
  - by extension, any frequency in-between
  - notation:
     - scientific:
        - subscript integer, from -1 to 10, e.g. A‚ÇÑ
     - helmhotz pitch notation:
        - -1 to 2: uppercase, with 2-n subscript prime symbols, e.g. A or A‚Ä≥
           - or 2-n repeated uppercase letter, e.g. AAA
        - 3 to 10: lowercase, with n-3 superscript prime symbols
  - name:
     - nth octave, e.g. 4th octave
     - sub-subcontra or octocontra (-1), sub-contra (0), contra (1), great (2), small (3), one-lined (4), two-lined (5), etc.
     - etc.|triple|double low (<=1), low (2), tenor [middle] (3), middle (4), treble or tenor high (5), high (6), double|triple|etc. high (>=7)
  - "bass"/"treble": low|high pitch

Ranges:
  - musical range: instrument-specific
     - piano: A0 to C8
     - pedal harp: C‚ô≠1 to G‚ô≠7
     - concert flute: C4 to C7
     - violin: G3 to A7
     - saxophone: D‚ô≠3 to A‚ô≠5
     - guitar: E2 to E4
     - bass guitar: E1 to G3
  - voice range:
     - soprano: C4 to C6
     - mezzo-soprano: A3 to A5
     - contralto: F3 to F5
     - tenor: C3 to C5
     - baritone: A2 to A4
     - bass: E2 to E4
  - poor audible range: 20 Hz (E0) to 15 kHz (A‚ôØ9)
  - good audible range: 12 Hz (G-1) to 28 kHz (A10)

Pitch class:
  - specific position of a frequency within any octave
     - e.g. C‚ôØ
  - same pitch class, different octave:
     - double frequency
     - sounds similar

Chromatic scale:
  - attributes 12 possible pitch classes in a given octave
  - i.e. discretization to simplify
  - notations:
     - C C‚ôØ D D‚ôØ E F F‚ôØ G G‚ôØ A A‚ôØ B
     - C D‚ô≠ D E‚ô≠ E F G‚ô≠ G A‚ô≠ A B‚ô≠ B
  - semitone:
     - difference between 2 chromatic notes
     - multiply frequency by 2**(1/12) (if equally-tempered)
     - i.e. 12th is double (octave)

Diatonic scale:
  - like chromatic scale but only C D E F G A B
  - i.e. same but only omits accidental notes
  - romance languages: do re mi fa sol la si

Accidental note:
  - note in chromatic scale but not diatonic
  - also called chromatic notes, as opposed to diatonic notes
  - black keys on a piano, as opposed to white
  - supposedly more somber

Accidental variation:
  - written left to note on a score
  - can be:
     - ùÑ™ (double-sharp): +2
     - ‚ôØ (sharp, major): +1
     - ‚ôÆ (natural): +0
     - ‚ô≠ (flat, minor): -1
     - ùÑ´ (double-flat): -2

Score:
  - horizontal lines used as music notation
  - staff position: vertical position of a note
  - can be:
     - half step: 1 diatonic note, half a line
     - step: 2 diatonic notes, 1 line
     - musical scale: 1 octave, 4 linesClef:
     - first symbol indicating pitch of bottom line

Psychoacoustics:
  - pitch perception is not purely objective
