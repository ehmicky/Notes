Octave:
  - ratio of 2 between 2 frequencies
  - by extension, any frequency in-between
  - notation:
     - scientific:
        - subscript integer, from -1 to 10, e.g. A₄
     - helmhotz pitch notation:
        - -1 to 2: uppercase, with 2-n subscript prime symbols, e.g. A or A″
           - or 2-n repeated uppercase letter, e.g. AAA
        - 3 to 10: lowercase, with n-3 superscript prime symbols
  - name:
     - nth octave, e.g. 4th octave
     - sub-subcontra or octocontra (-1), sub-contra (0), contra (1), great (2), small (3), one-lined (4), two-lined (5), etc.
     - etc.|triple|double low (<=1), low (2), tenor [middle] (3), middle (4), treble or tenor high (5), high (6), double|triple|etc. high (>=7)
  - "bass"/"treble": low|high pitch

  - poor audible range: 20 Hz (E0) to 15 kHz (A♯9)
  - good audible range: 12 Hz (G-1) to 28 kHz (A10)

Pitch class:
  - specific position of a frequency within any octave
     - e.g. C♯
  - same pitch class, different octave:
     - double frequency
     - sounds similar

Psychoacoustics:
  - pitch perception is not purely objective
