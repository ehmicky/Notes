Octave:
  - ratio of 2 between 2 frequencies
  - by extension, any frequency in-between
  - notation:
     - scientific:
        - subscript integer, from -1 to 9
     - helmhotz pitch notation:
        - -1 to 2: uppercase, with 2-n subscript prime symbols
           - named sub-subcontra, sub-contra, contra, great
        - 3 to 9: lowercase, with n-3 superscript prime symbols
           - named small, one-lined, two-lined, etc.
  - concert pitch: A4, 440Hz

Pitch class:
  - specific position of a frequency within any octave
  - same pitch class, different octave:
     - double frequency
     - sounds similar

Chromatic scale:
  - attributes 12 possible notes in a given octave
  - i.e. discretization to simplify
  - notations:
     - C C‚ôØ D D‚ôØ E F F‚ôØ G G‚ôØ A A‚ôØ B
     - C D‚ô≠ D E‚ô≠ E F G‚ô≠ G A‚ô≠ A B‚ô≠ B
  - semitone:
     - difference between 2 chromatic notes
     - multiply frequency by 2**(1/12)
     - i.e. 12th is double (octave)
  - quarter tone: half a semitone

Diatonic scale:
  - like chromatic scale but only C D E F G A B
  - i.e. same but only omits accidental notes
  - romance languages: do re mi fa sol la si

Accidental note:
  - note in chromatic scale but not diatonic
  - also called chromatic notes, as opposed to diatonic notes
  - black keys on a piano, as opposed to white
  - supposedly more somber

Accidental variation:
  - written left to note on a score
  - can be:
     - ùÑ™ (double-sharp): +2
     - ‚ôØ (sharp, major): +1
     - ‚ôÆ (natural): +0
     - ‚ô≠ (flat, minor): -1
     - ùÑ´ (double-flat): -2

Score:
  - horizontal lines used as music notation
  - staff position: vertical position of a note
  - can be:
     - half step: 1 diatonic note, half a line
     - step: 2 diatonic notes, 1 line
     - musical scale: 1 octave, 4 linesClef:
     - first symbol indicating pitch of bottom line
