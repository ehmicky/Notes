Tone:
  - pure|simple tone: perfect sound with a single sine wave (periodic)
  - musical|complex tone: composed of multiple pure tones ("partials")
     - combining or deriving is akin to a Fourier transform
        - i.e. math formula involving combining/deriving sine waves to/from any periodic function
  - musical note: musical tone (periodic part) + aperiodic parts (vibrato, envelope, etc.)

Harmonic:
  - in a complex tone, partial which frequency is a multiple of the lowest partial
  - lowest partial is also considered an harmonic
     - called "fundamental"
     - its pitch dominates (in human perception)
  - higher harmonic is "overtone"
     - it gives the complex tone its timber
     - "nth harmonic" means multiple is n
        - e.g. 3rd harmonic's frequency is 3x the fundamental
  - "ideal harmonic" is the frequency that a given partial ("real harmonic") should be to be considered fully harmonic
     - i.e. to be an exact multiple of the fundamental harmonic
     - difference is "harmonicity"/"inharmonicity"

Interference beat:
  - if two partials in a complex note:
     - create a third partial resulting from the changing sum of both
  - if harmonic, the third partial has a constant amplitude, i.e. sounds nice
  - else, the amplitude oscillates, creating a beat
  - beat frequency equals the difference between:
      - the higher frequency
      - the lower frequency's closest harmonic

Harmonic series:
  - complex tone with harmonics
  - perceived pitch of the whole complex tone is of the fundamental harmonic
  - most vibrating instruments (string, wind) are tuned and desiged to produce those
