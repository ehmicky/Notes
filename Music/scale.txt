Chromatic scale:
  - attributes 12 possible pitch classes in a given octave
  - i.e. discretization to simplify
  - notations:
     - C C♯ D D♯ E F F♯ G G♯ A A♯ B
     - C D♭ D E♭ E F G♭ G A♭ A B♭ B
  - semitone:
     - difference between 2 chromatic notes
     - multiply frequency by 2**(1/12) (if equally-tempered)
     - i.e. 12th is double (octave)

Diatonic scale:
  - like chromatic scale but only C D E F G A B
  - i.e. same but only omits accidental notes
  - romance languages: do re mi fa sol la si

Score:
  - horizontal lines used as music notation
  - staff position: vertical position of a note
  - can be:
     - half step: 1 diatonic note, half a line
     - step: 2 diatonic notes, 1 line
     - musical scale: 1 octave, 4 linesClef:
     - first symbol indicating pitch of bottom line

Minor scale:
  - black keys on a piano, as opposed to white
  - supposedly more somber
