Musical note:
  - pitch: frequency
  - value: duration
  - dynamics: loudness
  - articulation: changes (attack/decay) in timbre or pitch
  - instrument-specific techniques

Octave:
  - ratio of 2 between 2 frequencies
  - by extension, any frequency in-between
  - notation:   
     - scientific:      
        - subscript integer, from -1 to 9   
     - helmhotz pitch notation:      
        - -1 to 2: uppercase, with 2-n subscript prime symbols         
           - named sub-subcontra, sub-contra, contra, great      
        - 3 to 9: lowercase, with n-3 superscript prime symbols 
  - standard pitch: A4  

Pitch class:
  - specific position of a frequency within any octave
  - same pitch class, different octave:   
     - double frequency
     - sounds similar   

Chromatic scale:
  - attributes 12 possible notes in a given octave
  - i.e. discretization to simplify
  - notations:   
     - C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B   
     - C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B
  - semitone:   
     - difference between 2 chromatic notes   
     - multiply frequency by 2**(1/12)   
     - i.e. 12th is double (octave)

Diatonic scale:
  - like chromatic scale but only C D E F G A B
  - i.e. same but only omits accidental notes
  - romance languages: do re mi fa sol la si
Accidental note: 
  - note in chromatic scale but not diatonic
  - also called chromatic notes, as opposed to diatonic notes
  - black keys on a piano, as opposed to white
  - supposedly more somber
Accidental variation:
  - written left to note on a score
  - can be:  
  - x (double-sharp): +2  
  - # (sharp, major): +1  
  - (natural): +0  
  - b (flat, minor): -1  
  - bb (double-flat): -2
Score:
  - horizontal lines used as music notation
  - staff position: vertical position of a note
  - can be:   
  - half step: 1 diatonic note, half a line   
  - step: 2 diatonic notes, 1 line   
  - musical scale: 1 octave, 4 lines  Clef:
  - first symbol indicating pitch of bottom line
Note value:
  - sound duration
  - can be:   
  - double: 2   
  - whole: 1   
  - half: 1/2   
  - quarter: 1/4   
  - eighth: 1/8   
  - sixteenth: 1/16   
  - thirty-second: 1/32   
  - sixty-fourth: 1/64   
  - hundred twenty-heigth: 1/128
