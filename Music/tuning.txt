Tuning practice:
  - fixing instrument to make it match a tuning system
  - mechanism is instrument-specific
     - e.g. turning pegs on a guitar
  - can use:
     - perfect hear
     - reference note from another instrument
        - including player at same time and hearing interference beat
     - using a device
  - usually start with one note
     - usually "A440"
        - A4, 440Hz ("concert pitch")
     - then adjust rest of instrument with parts already tuned
     - usual order is instrument-specific

Tuning system:
  - attributing intervals (i.e. pitch frequencies) to chromatic notes
  - none is perfect
     - each allows specific intervals to be more harmonic at the expense of others
     - some are harder to tune

Just|pure intonation:
  - any tuning system using "just|pure intervals"
    - rational numbers
    - noted as fractions n/m or n:m
  - often used for bow string instruments

n-limit just intonation
  - also called n[-prime] limit tuning
  - just intonation where each integer uses prime factors <= n

5-limit just intonation:
  - only uses factors of 2, 3 or 5
  - usually uses 3 intervals:
     - i.e. a tetrachord
     - called:
        - T: greater|major tone, slightly higher than 200¢
        - t: lesser|minor tone, slightly lower than 200¢
        - s: [just diatonic] semitone, slightly different than 100¢, for E-F and B-C
  - can be:
     - Ptolemy's intense|tense diatonic:
        - also named "syntonous|syntonic diatonic", "Ptolemaic sequence", "justly tuned major scale"
        - T: 9:8 (204¢)
        - t: 10:9 (182¢)
        - s: 16:15 (112¢)
        - intervals from C: T t s T t T s
        - i.e. ratios from C: D 9:8, E 5:4, F 4:3, G 3:2, A 5:3, B 15:8
     - alternate:
        - T t s: same
        - intervals from C: t T s T t T s
        - i.e. ratios from A: B 9:8, C 6:5, D 4:3, E 3:2, F 8:5, G 9:5

Equal temperament:
  - tuning using logarithmically equal intervals
     - i.e. irrational numbers
  - n-equal temperament means for n-chromatic scale
     - each interval multiplies pitch by 2^(1/n)
  - pros:
     - intervals of a given amount of notes always have same pitch difference
     - consistency between notes
        - useful on instruments which cannot add microtones
  - useful in keyboard instruments, where it is often used
     - for pianos, stretch tuning is used too, i.e. not perfectly equally-tempered
