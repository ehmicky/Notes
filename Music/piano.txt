Acoustics issues:
  - in principle:
     - string length should double for each octave
     - this would make piano too long
     - so string width is also thicked out, which also decreases pitch
  - lowest notes tend to be inharmonic:
     - strings that are much tinner than long create overtunes that are naturally harmonic
        - this is how most string instruments are
     - however, lowest piano strings are wider, thus encounter a physical resistance to bending
        - this makes overtunes sharper
        - i.e. longer pianos have less of a problem
  - highest notes tend to be inharmonic:
     - they must be thin and|or with high tension
     - thinness and tension is imperfect because limited by the strength|quality of the steel
     - this makes overtunes flatter

Stretch tuning
  - also called "widening"
  - fixes acoustics issues described above
  - tuning highest notes to be sharper and lowest notes flatter
     - pro: more harmonic overtunes
     - con: less equally tempered notes
  - since octave is not precise, it is called "pseudo-octave", "paradoxical octave" or "piano tuners' octave"
  - Railsback curve:
     - function describing typical difference (in¢) between a piano note's pitch and its  ideally equally tempered pitch
     - difference:
        - A0: 60¢
        - E1: 20¢
        - C2: 10¢
        - E2: 5¢
        - E4: 0¢
        - E6: 5¢
        - C7: 10¢
        - G7: 20¢
        - B8: 30¢
