ALTERNATIVES ==>                  #All are Node.js only:
                                  #  - andreasmadsen trace (prefered):
                                  #     - high-profile
                                  #     - uses ASYNC_HOOKS
                                  #     - supports stackTraceLimit
                                  #  - longjohn:
                                  #     - high-profile but not well maintained
                                  #     - monkey-patches setTimeout(), etc. to retrieve current stack before firing callback
                                  #     - source map support
                                  #     - supports stackTraceLimit
                                  #     - does not work with PROMISEs
                                  #  - long-promise:
                                  #     - not maintained
                                  #     - uses ASYNC_HOOKS
                                  #     - only for PROMISEs and require manually calling a function on each ERROR
                                  #  - node-stackup:
                                  #     - not maintained
                                  #     - uses old version of ASYNC_HOOKS
                                  #  - asynctrace:
                                  #     - not maintained
                                  #     - uses old version of ASYNC_HOOKS

                                  #     - not maintained
                                  #     - uses domain API (deprecated)
                                  #     - supports stackTraceLimit
                                  #     - beautifies error

VERSION ==>                       #3.1.1

PERFORMANCE ==>                   #It has serious impact on CPU usage and slow things down
                                  #Also there is an important memory leak.
                                  #I.e. it should be used in development only.

HOW ==>                           #  - uses stack-chain (see its doc) to manipulate stack trace (using Error.prepareStackTrace())
                                  #  - create an ASYNC-HOOK (see Node core doc) that keeps track (in a global object) of current
                                  #    stack trace before starting any child microtask

require('trace')                  #Performs the substitution on require()
