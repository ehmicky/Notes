ALTERNATIVES ==>                  #  - stackman (prefered on Node):
                                  #     - Node and Chrome only
                                  #     - source map support
                                  #     - can be different lines of context for dependencies
                                  #     - parse ERROR.stack to object
                                  #  - tracekit (prefered on browsers):
                                  #     - Browser-only, but Node.js support can be worked out
                                  #     - parse ERROR.stack to object
                                  #  - better-stack-traces:
                                  #     - Node/Browser
                                  #     - not maintained
                                  #     - can be different lines of context for dependencies
                                  #     - directly change stack trace to include context without manual work
                                  #     - parse ERROR.stack as a string

GOAL ==>                          #Showing source code line (and surrounding lines of context) in a stack trace.
