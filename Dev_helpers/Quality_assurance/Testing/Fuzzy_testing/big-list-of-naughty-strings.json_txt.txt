                                  #  - reserved words in programming languages, OS
                                  #  - NUM, Unicode numbers
                                  #  - ASCII chars to escape, sequence of quotes
                                  #  - subscript/superscript, upside-down, Unicode font
                                  #  - common Unicode, two-byte chars, emoji
                                  #  - RTL
                                  #  - special whitespaces
                                  #  - Control chars, Unicode with special behavior (e.g. RTL override, BOM)
                                  #  - Unicode with different length when lowercased
                                  #  - corrupted Unicode
                                  #  - code injection (HTML, SQL, Bash, Ruby, XML)
                                  #  - normal words which can be blocked by profanity filters
                                  #Available as:
                                  #  - .txt
