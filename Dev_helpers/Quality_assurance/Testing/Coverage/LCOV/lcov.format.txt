SYNTAX ==>                        #Series of CATEGORY:VAL lines:
                                  #  - CATEGORY are on the left side below
                                  #  - FN|FNDA|BRDA|DA can be repeated for each file

TN                                #Arbitrary TEST_NAME, i.e. set of SF/end_of_record sections.
                                  #Must be first line.

SF                                #Single file, as its absolute '/PATH'
                                  #All the fields below are per-file, i.e. must be after a SF and before an end_of_record
end_of_record                     #End of single file
