GOAL ==>                          #Calculating:
                                  #  - number of runtime executions
                                  #     - i.e. also whether it was executed or not
                                  #  - of specific code structures (usually statements, lines, branches, functions, files)
                                  #Usually done for test coverage

APPROACHES ==>                    #Add counters (VAR++) before each line of code
                                  #Can either be:
                                  #  - by transforming source code
                                  #     - most performant
                                  #     - requires compile-step
                                  #  - by transforming bytecode
                                  #  - by adding it runtime
                                  #     - slowest
                                  #     - dynamic

FORMAT ==>                        #Dependent on vendor, or LCOV (see its doc)
                                  #Often reported using HTML, text, etc.

SOURCE MAP ==>                    #Must be thought for two distincts reasons:
                                  #  - if test coverage transforms source code, this introduces a compile-step
                                  #  - if source code has a source map, coverage should use it to report source line|columns
