GOAL ==>                          #Code instrumentation to produce coverage.
                                  #Done on V8 bytecode.

MODES ==>                         #Either:
                                  #  - "precise coverage": slow
                                  #  - "best efforts coverage": faster but imprecise (can lose information if function is
                                  #    out-of-scope and garbage collected)

DETAILS ==>                       #Includes:
                                  #  - function and branch hits, but not line hits (this is fixed by v8_to_istanbul though)
                                  #  - branches that were not hit
                                  #  - internal Node.js code
                                  #  - child processes, but not worker threads
