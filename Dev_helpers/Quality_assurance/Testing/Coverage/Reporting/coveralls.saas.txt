ALTERNATIVES ==>              #  - istanbul HTML reporter (prefered)
                              #  - coveralls (prefered if really needs history)
                              #  - codecov: very similar but slightly less high-profile

GOAL ==>                      #SaaS online LCOV reporting
                              #Also notify on changes

COVERALLS ==>                 #Nice coverage reports, with commit history.
                              #When using Travis:
                              #  - Automatic pull requests commenting.
                              #  - when defined, command line coveralls (and so Gulp plugins, etc.) use:
                              #     - ENVVAR TRAVID_JOB_ID: service_job_id
                              #     - TRAVIS_COMMIT: git_commit
                              #     - TRAVIS_BRANCH: git_branch
                              #     - "travis_ci": service_name
                              #Also supports Jenkins, Circle CI, Codeship
                              #Notifications: email, hipchat, campfile, webhook

coveralls                     #Command line (Node module 2.11.1)

                              #Uses ENVVAR:

                              #  - COVERALLS_RUN_AT DATE_STR (automatically defined)
                              #  - COVERALLS_GIT_COMMIT COMMIT_ID (e.g. HEAD) (automatically defined if in repo)
                              #  - COVERALLS_GIT_BRANCH LBRANCH (automatically defined if in repo)

GULP-COVERALLS()              #Takes lcov files in input, do same thing as command line coveralls
