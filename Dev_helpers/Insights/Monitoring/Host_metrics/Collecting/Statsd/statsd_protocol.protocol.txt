STATSD PROTOCOL ==>               #Protocol for:
                                  #  - client measuring metrics
                                  #  - to send to server aggregated and visualizing those
                                  #Meant to be generic and simple for clients, letting server do heavy tasks
                                  #Transport protocol-agnostic
                                  #  - often UDP is used, and sometimes TCP
                                  #  - often port 8125
                                  #Human readable
