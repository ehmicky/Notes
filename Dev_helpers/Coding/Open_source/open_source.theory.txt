NAMING ==>                        #  - should be the same for GitHub, package manager, domain name and in-code
                                  #  - should be descriptive, i.e. indicate what module does:
                                  #     - better SEO
                                  #     - more likely to be clicked on

TRADEMARKS ==>                    #  - definition:
                                  #     - anything showing source/origin/identity
                                  #     - only within a specific context
                                  #     - can be:
                                  #        - name
                                  #        - logo
                                  #        - "trade dress": trademark applied to colors/designs/look&feel
                                  #     - differences:
                                  #        - copyright: implementation
                                  #        - patent: logic/algorithm/idea
                                  #        - "service mark": like trademark but for a service instead of a product
                                  #  - cannot be similar sounding/looking, unless common words
                                  #     - i.e. prefer unusual words
                                  #  - name (not logo) should always:
                                  #     - be capitalized or all-uppercased to differentiate from surrounding text
                                  #     - be not combined/hyphenated with another word
                                  #     - be not abbreviated
                                  #     - use same spelling
                                  #     - not be pluralized
                                  #     - not be translated
                                  #     - used as a noun nor verb (but adjective or geround is ok)
                                  #  - symbols:
                                  #     - tm: registered or not
                                  #     - (R): registered
                                  #     - neither is required, it just advertise it
                                  #  - registering:
                                  #     - unregistered trademarks still work but harder to enforce
                                  #     - country/countries-specific
                                  #     - bureaucratic and expensive
                                  #     - must pay renewal fees every 10 years
                                  #     - can be made unregistered if project not used anymore
                                  #  - can transfer ownership to umbrella org like Linux fundation so they pay for trademarks and administrative things
                                  #  - by default fully restricted usage without permission except "nominative use":
                                  #     - when using name is necessary for understanding
                                  #     - e.g. "certification for {name}"

                                  #  - allow any use except:
                                  #     - if confuse about origin
                                  #        - e.g. saying it is official website or endorsed
                                  #     - if confuse about content
                                  #        - e.g. saying distribution {name} but not sating there are modifications
                                  #     - bundling our main code with another main code. However this is ok:
                                  #        - distributing modified version
                                  #        - distributing another main code but not bundled

                                  #     - for-profit user groups or goods
                                  #     - for domain names (for name)
                                  #     - not full website (for trade dress)
                                  #     - must be kept as is (for logo)
                                  #        - no modification nor combining with another logo
                                  #        - scaling and black&white is ok
                                  #  - should add:
                                  #     - (R) or tm next to first and most prominent name/logo on a page
                                  #     - footnote notice about trademark
