                              #     - git reset --hard
                              #  - recovering: reflog, git fsck --unreachable, stash

BRANCHING ==>                 #Branch goal is to put "half-done" code in separate chains:
                              #  - isolate from each other
                              #  - isolate from more stable code, e.g. a master can receive hotfixes without dealing with
                              #    conflicts with current development.

GIT FLOW ==>                  #Types of "branches":
                              #  - "long-living branches" with different stability level:
                              #     - levels:
                              #        - master: production ready (releases)
                              #           - version TAGs should only be applied on master
                              #        - devel: last integration state
                              #           - merged to master for minor and major releases
                              #     - each branch merges periodically to the one above.
                              #  - "supporting branches" (temporary):
                              #     - topic|feature branches:
                              #        - branches off devel, merges back to devel
                              #        - exist only downstream (private repos), not in public repo
                              #        - should rebase frequently to get upstream changes
                              #     - next|release-VERSION branches:
                              #        - branches off devel, merges back to master and devel
                              #        - exist in public repo
                              #        - when next release is ready feature-wise in devel, do the last testing|QA on this
                              #          temp branch (beta, rc, etc.)
                              #        - chooses VERSION number and whether it is minor|major at that stage
                              #     - hotfix/maintenance-* branches:
                              #        - branches off master
                              #        - merges to master and devel
                              #           - if next exists: master and next instead. devel can then merge from next if urgent
                              #        - bumps bugfix number
                              #     - support-* branches:
                              #        - when need to apply bugfix, but not to latest version of master
                              #        - branches off master, from past commit.
                              #        - apply fixes directly on the support-* branch
                              #        - cannot merge back, just delete when not supported anymore
                              #        - if decide to apply hotfix to newer commits though, can merge it to hotfix branch
                              #Small topic branches:
                              #  - often integrated into devel branch
                              #  - devel branch runs CI software to make sure it doesn't break other people changes
                              #  - don't do back-merge: pulling from devel on a topic branch, often to get some features done
                              #    by others (means topic branches not independant|small enough). If still done, use
                              #    cherry-pick
                              #Use pull --rebase, rebase temp branches before merging

git flow                      #Bash script (0.4.2-pre)
git flow init [-d]            #Does (interactively unless -d):

git flow f publish NAME       #Push to origin: git fetch origin, git push origin
git flow f pull REMOTE NAME   #Pull from origin: git pull

GITHUB FLOW ==>               #Everyone has a fork of the origin.
                              #Instead of merging to master|develop locally, send a pull request to origin.

OTHER MODELS ==>              #Other smaller model:
                              #  - only a master branch with topic|hotfixes branches
                              #  - simpler for smaller projects, but harder to stabilize release candidates (no next branch)

POSSIBLE SETUPS ==>           #Centralized: each developer push/pull from one Git server
                              #  - There can be different level of write access, e.g. few can write on master branch, but
                              #    anyone can create topic branches
                              #Integration manager:
                              #  - There is one official Git server, managed by one maintainer.
                              #  - Developers have their own Git server. They fork the official Git server, i.e.:
                              #     - Maintain a LRBRANCH to upstream project to pull updates.
                              #     - Use specific LBRANCH instead of using/merging to/pushing master branch.
                              #       Master branch will only be used as a reference to LRBRANCH, and LBRANCH the forked
                              #       modifications will be pushed.
                              #     - Send pull requests upstream when work is done (often a specific feature).
                              #       Can use git request-pull.
                              #       Maintainer will pull the fork if agreed.
                              #        - Some other projects prefer to get patches by email.
                              #  - Advantage: level of control, while still allowing developers to work at their own pace and
                              #    have write access without maintainer controlling access control/adding new users.
                              #  - If several developers need to work on one branch, can create it and ask them to send pull
                              #    requests.
                              #Dictator/Lieutenant:
                              #  - Same but there are several degrees of maintainer.
                              #  - First-level maintainers are "lieutenants", and they send pull requests themselves to the
                              #    "dictator benevolent" who manage the official repository.

BEST PRACTICES ==>            #  - Do backups
                              #  - Don't modify history of already pushed commits or if there are downstream branches:
                              #    rebase, commit --amend, filter-branch
                              #      - It would force everyone downstream to rebase, otherwise a normal merge will create
                              #        duplicate commits
                              #      - For the first two, post-rewrite HOOK is fired
                              #  - Don't retag already pushed tags
                              #  - Divide modules into different repositories

COMMIT BEST PRACTICES ==>     #Comment:
                              #  - Should explicit what's been done.
                              #  - Good style:
                              #     - short one-liner (50 chars) summary followed by blank line then paragraphes of changes
                              #       (present tense, contrast with previous behavior).
                              #     - Should put blank lines between paragraphes, and between bullet points (that start with
                              #       space then dash then space), with 72 chars wrapping.
                              #     - Use imperative instead of past|present
                              #     - Show why it should have changed and how it did
                              #Commits:
                              #  - Put related changes in separate commits, for easier diff/recovery/managing.
                              #    If several features at once, separate them, including using git add --patch
                              #  - Do small commits, possibly squashing them locally later
                              #Do not commit:
                              #  - anything that can be regenerated from source (compilation, autodoc, archives, etc.)
                              #  - local conf files
                              #  - big files
                              #  - OS-specific files
                              #  - log files

GIT SERVER ==>                #REPO used to share work of several developers.
                              #DIR is often called PROJECT.git/
                              #Since only cloned but not manipulated, should be a "bare REPO":
                              #  - only the .git/
                              #  - allow getting pushed
                              #  - CONFVAR core.bare true
                              #  - created by clone|init --bare
                              #Mirror repository: Git server that duplicates another, to provide backups, or scale performance.

REMOTE REPOSITORY ==>         #.git/ that can be accessed|written from outside.
                              #Can use protocols:
                              #  - Local (file:///PATH.git, implies --local with git clone)
                              #     or /PATH.git (does not imply --local with git clone)):
                              #     - when using NFS or using same computer
                              #  - SSH (ssh://USER@SERVER/PATH.git or USER@SERVER:PATH.git):
                              #     - only that can write.
                              #     - But to allow read without requesting client to setup SSH, use Git/HTTP for read.
                              #     - Access control:
                              #        - Good idea to have only one "git" user account with shell /usr/bin/git-shell in
                              #          /etc/passwd (restricted shell), and ask public keys of people who want to push.
                              #        - Gitolite permits different access control (otherwise every SSH user has full
                              #          read+write access to everything), which can be turned on by branches.
                              #  - Git (git://PATH.git): faster, but harder to setup (better than HTTP then).
                              #  - HTTP (http://PATH.git): slower, but easier to setup: enable HOOK post-update from
                              #    .git/hooks/post-update.sample
