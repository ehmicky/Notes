VCS ==>                           #Version Control System
                                  #Goal:
                                  #  - keeping track of changes: reverting changes, viewing history
                                  #  - collaboration: conflict handling
                                  #Architecture:
                                  #  - client-server
                                  #  - distributed: each client has full copy of the repository. Advantages:
                                  #     - no SPOF: if repository goes down, can restore it
                                  #     - fewer server interaction: faster, and can work offline
                                  #     - more types of relations between each copy are possible:
                                  #        - fake client-server (centralized) 
                                  #        - hierarchical (subrepositories and super-repositories) 
                                  #        - constellation
