        - AUTH_URL: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
        - no response_type|grant_type parameters
        - no scope parameters, always '' in response

           - def: ones specified in App settings
           - can|should specify multiple ones
        - additional parameters to GET AUTH_URL:
           - ?login=USER: prompt user to login

           - refresh_token_expires_in
        - ACCESS_TOKEN start with ghu_*, REFRESH_TOKEN with ghr_*
     - can choose wheter to do it at installation time, instead of at first usage time
        - installation redirects to GET https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
        - CALLBACK_URL: always use default one
        - no ?state
     - refreshing
        - expiration must be opted in
        - always 8h for ACCESS_TOKEN, 6 months for REFRESH_TOKEN
        - flow (see OAuth doc): TOKEN_URL https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
     - revoking:
        - DELETE /applications/CLIENT_ID/token
        - can also be done by user
        - triggers 'github_app_authorization' webhook
           - should undo the app logic for that user
