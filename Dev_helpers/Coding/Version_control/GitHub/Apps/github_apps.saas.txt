                                  #  - i.e. some actions available with ACCESS_TOKEN but not IAT

Authentication as user:
  - requires an app "authorize"
  - shown as done by user, with additional hint it's been done through an app
  - restricted by user permissions
  - UAT:
     - revoking:
        - DELETE /applications/CLIENT_ID/token
        - can also be done by user
        - triggers 'github_app_authorization' webhook
           - should undo the app logic for that user
     - passed as Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN [C]
