Take ajv output and turn it into human-friendly error message.

Replace jest-validate with this

SCHEMA.x-deprecated BOOL: process.emitWarning() with DeprecationWarning

Memoize ajv validation
  - can be turned off with an option

Wrapper around ajv:
  - separate ajv error message prettifier to its own module

On validation errors, show SCHEMA.examples|default

Make it specific to function arguments validation with good support for:
  - variadic arguments
  - deep objects
  - optional arguments, either positional or named
  - multiple top-level commands

Maybe make it declarative, with one configuration file for all top-level commands per project
  - i.e. get validation + CLI from single conf file

Separate project to generate CLI input code from it:
  - check alternatives to yargs to see if should be based on yargs or not
  - generates whole code I usually do for CLI, including --help, --version, etc.

awesome JSON schema

JSON schema guide:
  - my Notes doc, but as a README for others
  - including OpenAPI support
