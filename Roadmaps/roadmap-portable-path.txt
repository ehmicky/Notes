PORTABLE-PATH('PATH'[, OPTS])[->ERROR]

By default throws, but there is an option to remove that

Rules:
  - is string
  - is not empty (after trimming)
  - strip root on Windows (backslashes can be slashes):
     - LETTER:\
     - \\HOST\
     - \\?[\UNC]\ (can be combined with one of two above)
     - \\.\
  - then path.normalize()
  - allow both / and \ on Windows, but no \ on Unix
  - does not start with `-` -> creates confusion with CLI flags
  - does not end with space or dot -> Windows
  - no tilde if whole filename and starts with it
  - no whitespaces -> uses on CLI to separate arguments
  - no non-ASCII -> it does not work well with cmd.exe (which does not have Unicode support by default)
  - no [ ] # % & { } $ ! ' ` | " < > * ? ; -> special Bash meaning
  - not starting with ~ (temporary file on Windows, home directory on Unix) or ending with ~ (Vim temporary files)
  - no ^ + @ -> special Windows CLI meaning
  - no `:` -> invalid on Windows|Mac
  - no control chars -> invalid on Windows
  - no * " | < > ? -> invalid on Windows
  - max filename length 255 -> for most filesystems
  - max path 260 -> Windows
  - invalid filenames: com1, com2, com3, com4, com5, com6, com7, com8, com9, lpt1, lpt2, lpt3, lpt4, lpt5, lpt6, lpt7, lpt8,
    lpt9, con, nul, prn, aux -> Windows
  - is lowercase -> NTFS/APFS/HFS+ are case insensitive

Supports:
  - Windows: NTFS, ReFS
  - Linux: ext3, ext4, XFS, ZFS, BTRFS
  - Mac: APFS, HFS+
  - use lowest common denominator. No OPTS.filesystem|os

test on my root directory to see what is not portable

Readme:
  Operating systems and file systems have different constraints for file paths and filenames: maximum length, allowed characters, etc.
  `portable-path` ensures file paths are valid on any OS (Windows/Mac/Linux/BSD). Files are usually copied to different OS due to:
    - library used by users
    - different environments (development vs production)
    - colleagues/contributors with different machines
    - continuous integration run on multiple OS
    - SaaS/PaaS provider
  For both source files and dynamic files
  Language-agnostic

Logo: /portable/path with programming font, different colors for slashes, and maybe dark terminal-like background
