Add REGEXP named groups (through babel)

`symbolic` can use `ugo` as a permission character:
  - e.g. `u+g` means "add all permissions from `group`"
     - excluding special permissions
  - only a single character, e.g. `u+gg`, `u+go` and `u+gw` are invalid
  - if several comma-separated group, merge them with last one having priority (including `o+u,o+g` or `o+u,o-r`)

`chmod` has particular behavior for `setuid` and `setgid` on directories:
  - `octal` can only set them, but not unset them
  - `symbolic` with `=` does not modify them

Any `chmod` unsets `setgid` if current `gid` does not match file's owning group

`+X` is noop if "u", "g" and "o" do not have "x" and is not a directory
