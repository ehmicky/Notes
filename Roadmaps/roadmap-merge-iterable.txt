OPTS.order FUNC(OBJ_ARR)->OBJ
  - determine the order of both:
     - calling .next()
     - yield
  - OBJ_ARR:
     - does not include iterators already done
     - includes iterators currently running, so can repeat
  - not called if OBJ_ARR.length 1
  - OBJ:
     - iterable ITERABLE
     - index NUM: from original ARR input, i.e. works as an id
     - count NUM: of times being selected as next (not of yields)
     - duration NUM: in nanosecs, spent in .next()
  - example of usages:
     - weighted pick
     - random pick
     - equal duration spent
     - serial order, or strided

OPTS.concurrency NUM (def: Inf)
  - only for async
  - still respects OPTS.order
     - results of promises that end before the previous one are buffered
     - exceptions are propagated right away
     - if no OPTS.order, selects in serial order, but yields first that resolves
