AWS SAM
  - compare with CDK, Sceptre and Rain
  - merge with the "Alternatives" section from Sceptre
  - maybe break down SAM|CDK|CloudFormation|Sceptre|rain for specific features: assets, validation, deploy stack, live reload (e.g. CDK --hotswap, sam sync), etc.
     - e.g. should move logs to CloudWatch|Lambda docs
  - move SAM CLI|transform|SAR doc to own SERVICEs
     - including the "special RESTYPEs" documentation from `sam package` doc to their respective docs instead
        - also AWS::Serverless|Lambda::Function ImageUri
     - if not documented yet, add to `new_services` doc instead
        - e.g. sam remote invoke: SQS, Step Functions, Kinesis
  - delete all resources created in AWS
  - check difference with `serverless` framework

Create CLI that combines|forwards|unifies CDK, SAM CLI, Sceptre, Rain
  - see my summaries in CDK doc
  - create GitHub action that `npm publish` GitHub releases automatically
     - goal: putting SAM, Sceptre, Rain on npm

Create TypeScript template with CDK, Lambda, etc.
