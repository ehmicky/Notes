Go through "dependencies" documentation

Try to use Univeral JavaScript:
  - promote once using Universal JavaScript:
     - keep-func-props
  - make test-examples test JavaScript in browsers too
  - consider using c8 instead of nyc
     - unless it is not possible with Universal JavaScript
     - document https://github.com/bcoe/v8-coverage
  - libraries meant to work in browser too should use ESM in doc/examples

Go through "Code review" documentation

Go through "Git/GitHub/coding" documentation
  - Probot:
     - check documentation
     - check available ones (any GitHub app, not just Probot)
     - use it (unless already available) for after every closed issue/PR:
        - add templated content. For our use case:
           - encourage starring and promoting
           - fill in a survey
        - can use conditions for skipping. For our use case:
           - only the first time a user contributed

finish babel (see roadmap)

Go through documentation of:
  - markdown
  - textlint
  - check for dead links projects
     - including awesome_bot
     - add to all my projects markdown
     - do it as a cron task for portable-node-guide
  - validate/fix markdown links so they use footnotes:
     - i.e. use [...][] links instead of [...](...) in Markdown
  - documentation
  - static website generators

Go through Async documentation
  - fix log-process-errors exit issue (see its roadmap)

Go through Functional documentation
  - replace my functional utilities found in most of my projects by a library

autoformat (see roadmap)

extract and complete JSON references tool
  - use it in test-openapi

publish-check (see roadmap)

eslint-plugin-portable (see roadmap)

Fix task.validate in test-openapi (see Google note)

JSON schema v4/v7 v7/v4 converters
  - add support to v7 in test-openapi

sourcemaps (see roadmap)

test-openapi OpenAPI 3.0 support

Go through "testing" documentation

extract logging from autoserver / "autogging"
  - also see Google note

API system information:
  - extract the `serverinfo` part of autoserver
  - goal: host information for API logs
  - check what can be added
     - check `systeminformation` library I documented
     - check if bug error message of `test-openapi` can be improved

Turn gulp-shared-tasks into its own project:
  - goal: opinionated 0-config build system
  - rebrand it
  - hide the gulp dependency
  - should be 0-config
  - should default ESLint + prettier config to ESLint standard + ESLint-prettier
     - but allow overridding if an ESLint config or Prettier config file is present
        - e.g. I would use it to use eslint-config-standard-prettier-fp instead
