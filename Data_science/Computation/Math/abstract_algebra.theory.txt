Identity:
  - ∀ x,... s = t
     - i.e. s = t true for any x,... and only using x,... as free variables
  - any formula with:
     - equality
     - a finite set of variables

Algebraic structure:
  - also named algebra
  - consists of:
     - domain: a non-empty set A:
        - also named underlying|carrier set
     - one|several operations on A with specific arity:
        - f: A * A * ... -> A
     - axioms: finite set of identities for those operations
     - scalar set: optional second set R
        - e.g. f: R * A -> A

Free object:
  - specific algebraic structure
     - without additional axioms but the ones of the structure itself
     - i.e. as generic as possible
  - e.g.: free magma|etc.

Partial algebraic structure:
  - when operations are partial functions instead of functions
  - e.g. partial magma|etc.

Unary system:
  - any algebraic structure with a single unary operation f: S -> S

Magma:
  - also named groupoid, but avoid because means several things
  - any algebraic structure with a single binary operation: f: S * S -> S

Group:
  - set S with f: S * S -> S
  - f must satisfy group axioms:
     - closure
     - associativity
     - identity
     - invertibility

Algebraic operations:
  - for a specific algebraic structure, all binary functions taking such structure as both input and output
  - can use constants or variables operands

Algebraic expression:
  - expression with only algebraic operations
     - i.e. generalization of algebraic operations composition
