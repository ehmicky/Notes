Number:
  - algebraic structure for counting
  - goal:
     - cardinal: counting
     - ordinal: ordering (e.g. 3th)
     - nominal: labelling, i.e. only use numeral, not number value (e.g. Zip code)

Number sets:
  - ℕ :
     - also noted N
     - named positive integers, or natural|whole|counting numbers
     - any number that can be expressed with additions of 1 (including none)
     - {x: (x - 1∈ N) || (x = 0)}
     - 0:
        - usually included in modern definitions:
           - noted N₀ or N⁰
        - in past, was not included
           - noted N*, N+ or N₁
  - ℤ :
     - also noted Z
     - named integers
     - any number that can be expressed with addition|subtraction and operands ∈ N
     - {x-y: x,y∈ N}
  - ℚ :
     - also noted Q
     - named rational numbers
     - any number that can be expressed with addition|subtraction|multiplication|subtraction and operands ∈ N
     - {x/y: x,y∈ Z, y != 0}
  - ℝ :
     - also noted R
     - real numbers
     - any number that can be expressed with addition|subtraction|multiplication|subtraction and exponeniation (except with fractional exponent and negative base) and operands ∈ N
     - I:
        - named irrational numbers
        - if ∈ R && ∉ Q
  - ℂ :
     - also noted C
     - complex numbers
     - any number that can be expressed with any algebraic operation (addition|subtraction|multiplication|subtraction|exponeniation) and operands ∈ N
  - transcendental numbers:
     - any number that cannot be expressed as algebraic expression

Divisor:
  - also named factor|multiple
  - y is divisor of x if yz = x and y,z∈ N
  - divisible: inverse

Greatest common divisor (GCD):
  - maximum divisor of two numbers
  - Euclidean algorithm:
     - func(a, b) => a == b
         ? a
         : a > b
           ? func(a - b, b)
           : func(a, b - a)
     (shorter version)
     - func(a, b) => b == 0
         ? a
         : func(b, a % b)

Least common multiple (LCM)
  - for two numbers, smallest number divisible by both

Prime number:
  - when x∈ N and only divisors are 1 and x itself
  - composite number: opposite
  - 0 and 1 are neither composite nor prime

Coprime
  - also named relatively prime
  - noted x ⊥ y
  - when x,y∈ N and only common divisor is 1

Factorization:
  - finding all prime divisors of a number
  - fundamental theorem of arithmetic
     - also called unique [prime] factorization theorem
     - if x∈ N, has exactly one factorization
        - except 0 and 1
  - canonical representation:
     - also named standard form
     - writing number as its factorization, with exponents if needed, ordered from smallest to highest base
        - e.g. 12 = 2^2 * 3

Normal number:
  - when infinite digits with uniform distribution
  - simply|absolutely normal: when for a specific|all bases

Golden ratio
  - noted φ or Φ (phi)
  - irrational number
  - φ = 1 + 1/φ, and φ > 0
  - implies:
     - if φ = x/y
     - then x/y = (x+y)/x
  - value:
     - exact: (1 + √5)/2
     - approximated: 1.618033...
