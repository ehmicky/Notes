Number has:
  - value
  - numeral:
     - representation|symbol|notation
     - digit: in positional notation, each position's symbol

Numeral systems:
  - can represent a specific set of number values (e.g. integers)
  - each number value has 1-n representations
     - if several, one might be standard/canonical
  - tries to represent the number value's arithmetic/algebraic properties
     - e.g. higher value -> more numerals

Main notation:
  - sign types:
     - arbitrary shape
     - letter:
        - either:
           - alphabetic numerals: following alphabetical order
           - acrophonic numerals: using number's word first letter
        - sometimes a symbol indicates that the letters are intended as number instead
     - lexical numerals: number word in full
     - real-life object (e.g. abascus)
  - notations:
     - sign-value:
        - each specific sign has a given value, regardless of position
           - big numbers are represented by adding more signs
        - radix|base is common divisor of signs
        - signs can either:
           - represent a single unit|exponent
              - e.g. 1|5|10|50|100
              - repeats to multiply
              - smaller digits set
              - called geometric numerals, because value is discontinuous
                 - as opposed to arithmetic numerals (e.g. 1-9) which are continuous
           - ciphered numerals: represent an exponated unit
              - e.g. 1-9e0-2
              - does not repeat
              - smaller numbers
     - multiplicative grouping systems:
        - mix between sign-value and positional notation
        - pairs of signs of unit[s] and exponent
           - often exponent 1e0 has no sign
        - unit[s] can be single|several
        - exponent sign can either:
           - be unique per exponent
           - always same, but repeated
     - positional|place-value:
        - digit value depends on position
        - makes arithmetic computation easier
        - radix|base:
           - exponentiation of each position
           - i.e. number of possible digits
           - notations:
              - xₘ, where m is radix
                - m can be b|o|d|h for 2|8|10|16
              - <m,Zₙ>, where m is radix and Zₙ is set of available digits, from 0 to n
                 - Zₙ can also be {DIGIT,...} instead
           - mixed radix:
              - when radix differs between position
              - multiple radices: when radices sequence repeats
                 - biquanary: when radices 5 and 2
           - radix economy:
              - information cost of using a specific base to represent a specific number
              - is m * n  where m is base and n is:
                 - ⌊log_m(n)⌋ + 1
                 - if m,n∈ N: same as .number of digits in n
              - e has lowest, followed by 2 and 3 (almost equal), 1 is very bad except for single digit, >3 gets worse and worse
        - digit separator:
           - separating each digit with always the same sign
           - useful when digit base is different from number base
              - e.g. base-60 numbers with base-10 digits
           - notations:

           - number of digits:
              - often 3
              - but can differ, e.g.:
                 - 4 in East Asia
                 - 2|4|8 in base 2|16
              - can vary, e.g. 3 then 2 in India
           - integer part only, or also fractional part
           - notations:
              - space (preferred)
              - ,
              - .
              - _
              - '
           - thousands separator: when grouping by 3 digits with a separator
        - standard:
           - when:
              - using digits
              - digits start at 0
              - single radix

Precision:
  - precision definition:
     - for single number:
        - amount of information
        - in positional notation: number of significant digits
     - for several numbers:
        - high precision of the shared information|digits among them
        - i.e. low difference between each other
     - as opposed to:
        - trueness: difference between expected and actual number, if precision was exact
        - accuracy: difference between expected and actual number
           - i.e. precision * trueness

        - implied both in leading|trailing position
        - in trailing position, called terminating decimal
     - infinite decimal expansion:
        - when repetend is smallest|highest digit, e.g. 0.2000...|0.1999...
        - has same value as removing repetend and (if highest digit) incrementing previous digit, e.g. 0.2
     - notations:

           - e.g. 12'345 = 345 - 121.212...
        - in other words: number - NNN0.../999 with as many 9s as N
           - e.g. 12'345 = 345 - 12000/99
           - 9 only in base 10. In base 8, this would be 7, etc.
        - if number first digit is 0, keeps position exponent
           - e.g 3'0 = 10 - 3.33...
        - if ' is at radix point, represent both as single ! instead
           - e.g. 3!1 = .1 - .33...
