ORDER THEORY ==>                  #Math branch about order

PARTIAL ORDER ==>                 #Binary relation that is:
                                  #  - transitive
                                  #  - antisymmetric
                                  #  - homogeneous

STRICT PARTIAL ORDER ==>          #Partial order that is not reflexive.
                                  #Also named "irreflexive", "strong".
                                  #E.g. <

NON-STRICT PARTIAL ORDER ==>      #Partial order that is reflexive.
                                  #Also named "reflexive", "weak".
                                  #E.g. <=

TOTAL ORDER ==>                   #Non-strict partial order where every element is strongly connectly ("total")
