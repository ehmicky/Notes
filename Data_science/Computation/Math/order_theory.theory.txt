ORDER THEORY ==>                  #Math branch about order

PARTIAL ORDER ==>                 #Binary relation that is:
                                  #  - transitive
                                  #  - antisymmetric

                                  #E.g. <

NON-STRICT PARTIAL ORDER ==>      #Partial order that is reflexive.
                                  #Also named "reflexive", "weak".
                                  #E.g. <=

                                  #Noted ⊤  or 1

                                  #  - partially ordered: there is 0-1 greatest element, but can be 0-n maximal elements
MINIMAL ELEMENT ==>               #Inverse of maximal element

                                  #  - e.g. infinite sets have no greatest|maximal element, but can have least upper bound
                                  #But:
                                  #  - greatest element is always least upper bound
