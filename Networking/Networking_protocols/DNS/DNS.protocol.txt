GOAL ==>                      #Translates hostname to IP address

DOMAIN NAME LABELS ==>        #  - delimited by dots
                              #  - max 253 chars
                              #  - [[:alnum:]-], with dash in middle of labels. Case-insensitive
                              #  - IDN (International domain name) allow using Punycode for non ASCII chars:
                              #     - clients show Unicode, but use ASCII under the hood
                              #     - applied to individual labels (prepended with xn--)
                              #     - IDN ccTLDs: TLD using IDN
                              #     - IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier):
                              #        - Like URI, but with UTF8 characters
                              #        - Like Punycode for DNS, but with percent encoding
                              #  - hierarchy:
                              #     - top-level domain (TLD):
                              #        - [IDN] ccTLD (country-specific), e.g. fr
                              #        - gTLD (generic), e.g. com, net, org, edu, jobs, info or gov
                              #        - iTLD (infrastructure): arpa
                              #        - pseudo-TLD: not registered with ICANN (must manually configure it)
                              #          - can be alternative root zones
                              #     - then subdomains
                              #     - if domain is associated to an IP, last subdomain is hostname
                              #     - FQDN (fully qualified domain name): domain name with all its labels
                              #     - DNS zone: serie of labels managed by a single company (e.g. top-level domains)
                              #  - There is a root empty label ("root zone"), managed by Verisign, registered with ICANN
                              #     - use clusters of 13 servers at http://a-m.root-servers.net/
                              #  - virtual hosting (several hostnames per machine):
                              #     - name-based:
                              #        - several hostnames per IP, 1 IP per machine
                              #        - Is harder to implement with HTTPS.
                              #        - When DNS doesn't work, harder to reach directly through IP.
                              #     - IP-based:
                              #        - 1 hostname per IP, several IPs per machine
                              #  - multiple hostnames can bind to single IP (virtual hosting), so a server can serve several
                              #    websites
                              #  - single hostname can bind to several IP, for load distribution / fault tolerance
                              #  - wildcard DNS records: putting * as leftmost label, so any domain name matching is
                              #    associated with same RR

DNS LOOKUP ==>                #  - use a DNS resolver
                              #  - starts with top label (root zone), which either gives IP of FQDN
                              #    ("authoritative name server"), or reference to lower label
                              #     - client query is non-recursive if it stops at each step
                              #     - sometimes the DNS server does the recursive query itself instead of refering to lower
                              #       label: recursive DNS server
                              #  - Caches:
                              #     - often root zones are cached (hints) by clients
                              #     - other client-side DNS caches are communicated by DNS servers with a TTL:
                              #        - as such, changes takes TTL to propagate
                              #        - some clients (e.g. many browsers) have a min TTL that overrides it
                              #          (e.g. 1min for Chrome)
                              #     - DNS servers can cache DNS resolution too
                              #  - /etc/resolv.conf:
                              #     - nameserver IP (DNS server to use)
                              #        - can be several (max: 3), queried in order
                              #        - if none: use local name server
                              #  - /etc/hosts: local file to assign DNS names to IP addresses locally
                              #     - IP DNS_NAME [DNS_NAME2...]
                              #  - reverse lookup:
                              #     - look for DNS names using IP address
                              #     - uses normal DNS lookup:
                              #        - e.g. IP ONE.TWO.THREE.FOUR -> FOUR.THREE.TWO.ONE.in-addr.arpa

PROTOCOL ==>                  #  - client-server
                              #  - over UDP on port 53. Uses TCP if sizes over 512
                              #  - Structure:
                              #     - header: query ID, Query or reply flag, Authoritative flag, Recursive query flag, DNS
                              #       server supports recursion flag, number of subsections (called Resource Records (RRs) for
                              #       all but query) in following sections
                              #     - query (if query):
                              #        - Name HOST
                              #        - Type TYPE
                              #     - reply (if reply) RR_ARR (several if multiple IPs for one FQDN, often random order to
                              #       achieve load balancing)
                              #     - authority RR_ARR
                              #     - additional RR_ARR
                              #  - RR:
                              #     - NAME: FQDN (must end with "." because of root zone) or just hostname.
                              #     - TYPE:
                              #        - A: IPv4
                              #        - AAAA: IPv6
                              #        - NS: refer to another DNS server (hostname or FQDN)
                              #        - CNAME: alias to another domain name ("canonical name")
                              #           - ex. use: different domain names but same IP and different ports
                              #           - MX|NS values should not point to a canonical name
                              #           - must be on subdomains, not the registered domain name
                              #           - must be unique Record Type for that NAME if present (e.g. cannot have also a AAAA
                              #             record)
                              #        - DNAME: like CNAME, but matches all subdomains too
                              #        - PTR: like CNAME, but stops DNS processing. Used for reverse DNS lookups
                              #        - MX: PRIORITY_NUM MAIL_DOMAIN
                              #        - SRV: PRIORITY_NUM WEIGHT PORT DOMAIN of specific services (used by many protocols)
                              #        - CERT: PKI certificate
                              #        - LOC: geolocation
                              #        - RP: email of the responsible person
                              #        - TXT: arbitrary data as "..." ... (max 255chars by "...")
                              #          (must quote all not [[:alnum:]- ], e.g. info about server
                              #        - SOA: DNS authority delegating that domain name
                              #          Format: DOMAIN EMAIL (replace @ with .) ( 5 NUM ):
                              #           - Version number (serial number or timestamp)
                              #           - Refresh time: cache TTL for all RRs ("zone file"). Often 15mins-1hour
                              #           - Retry time: how long to wait before retrying if problem
                              #           - Expire time: how long to stop retrying
                              #           - MinTTL: Min TTL for caching "domain not existing" responses (negative caching).
                              #             If a RR has a lower TTL, use it instead.
                              #     - CLASS: usually IN for internet
                              #     - TTL: tells client how long to cache it in secs (max 68 years)
                              #     - RDLENGTH, RDATA: value

WHOIS ==>                     #  - TCP protocol on port 43, which asks for info to DNS registrars about hostname

SECURITY ==>                  #  - DNSSEC: like IPSec but for DNS, to prevent DNS cache poisoning, etc.
                              #  - DNS spoofing (cache poisoning): changing DNS server caches, redirecting all DNS clients to
                              #    wrong IP
                              #  - IDN homograph attack: spoofing ASCII chars with similar looking Unicode, to do phishing
                              #     - preventions:
                              #        - Chrome|IE: show raw Punycode if all chars belong to user preferred language
                              #        - Firefox|Opera: show raw Punycode unless using special TLDs
                              #           - blocked by several TLDs
                              #  - typosquatting (URL hijacking): phishing relying on typo mistakes from end-user
                              #  - cybersquatting:
                              #     - buying domain name to sell them later
                              #     - renewal snatching: wait for expiration dates (if forget to renew before expiration),
                              #       using tools

TOOLS ==>                     #  - BIND: most widely used DNS software
                              #  - dig: query DNS
                              #     - zone file: file with all RRs of a given domain name:
                              #     - ;comment
                              #     - $ORIGIN DOMAIN
                              #     - $TTL 1h
                              #     - [NAME] CLASS TYPE [TTL] RDATA (def. NAME: same as before)

DEBUGGING ==>                 #  - about:dns, about:net-internals#dns (Chrome), about:networking#dns (Firefox): DNS caching
