HTTPS ==>                         #Using HTTP over SSL/TLS over TCP

Upgrade [C]                       #Alternative to using https:// to start connection
                                  #Should not be used as it leaves beginning of communication unencrypted

DOWNGRADE ATTACK ==>              #See cryptanalysis doc
                                  #Make HTTPS switch to HTTP instead
SSL STRIPING ==>                  #Specific HTTPS downgrade attack
                                  #When downgrade is done as a man-in-the-middle attack
                                  #I.e. proxy performs the downgrade
                                  #I.e. proxy can now read traffic unencrypted

MIXED CONTENT ==>                 #HTTPS page fetching some of its resources via HTTP
                                  #I.e. some resources do not benefit from HTTPS, even though users think they are
                                  #Includes:
                                  #  - scripts, images, HTML, etc.
                                  #  - cookies
                                  #     - i.e. should use "secure" attribute
                                  #Does not include:
                                  #  - navigation (e.g. links) from HTTPS to HTTP
                                  #  - file://... and http://locahost/...
                                  #Solutions:
                                  #  - HSTS
                                  #  - HTTP -> HTTPS redirects, either:
                                  #     - permanent redirects
                                  #     - Link; rel="canonical" [S]
                                  #  - relative URIs
UPGRADABLE CONTENT ==>            #Mixed content that is automatically upgraded to HTTPS by browsers
                                  #I.e. request is made using https://... instead
                                  #I.e. server might respond with 404
                                  #For:
                                  #  - <img|audio|video src>, <source>
                                  #  - CSS background-image, border-image, etc.
                                  #  - unless host is an IP address
BLOCKABLE CONTENT ==>             #Mixed content that is blocked by browsers
                                  #I.e. no request is made
                                  #For most content, including:
                                  #  - fetch(), XHR
                                  #  - NAVIGATOR.sendBeacon()
                                  #  - <script src>
                                  #  - <iframe src>
                                  #  - <img srcset>, <picture>
                                  #  - <object data>
                                  #  - <link href>
                                  #  - url() in CSS
                                  #  - Web fonts
                                  #  - any mixed download, i.e. when downloading
                                  #     - e.g. <a download>

Strict-Transport-Security:        #HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
 max-age=NUM[; includeSubDomains] #Ask client to redirect HTTP users to HTTPS instead
 [S]                              #For NUM seconds
                                  #Not done if SSL certificate invalid
                                  #Prevents SSL striping
  - Must be supplied over HTTPS, so:
     - does not work if initial connection is HTTP, or in the time window when max-age expired.
     - However, some browsers include a preloaded list of websites using this header.

PADDED FLAG ==>                   #On HEADERS|DATA|PUSH_PROMISE (HTTP/2)
                                  #Adds null-padding at end and padding length at beginning
