HTTPS:
  - using HTTP over SSL/TLS over TCP
  - initiating connection:
     - https:// protocol
     - Upgrade [C] for HTTPS: 
        - should not be used as it leaves beginning of communication unencrypted
  - mixed content:
     - HTTPS needs to be enable on all website resources, including scripts, all pages, etc., otherwise could attack on specific
       unsecure resources
        - this includes cookies (which should use "secure" attribute)
     - solutions:
        - HSTS
        - HTTP -> HTTPS permanent redirects, or using Link; rel="canonical" [S]
        - use relative URIs

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=NUM[; includeSubDomains] [S]:
  - also called HSTS
  - goal:
     - redirects visitors visiting the domain using HTTP to using HTTPS instead, for a specific period of time (in seconds)
     - does not allow visiting HTTPS page if certificate not ok
  - Must be supplied over HTTPS, so:
     - does not work if initial connection is HTTP, or in the time window when max-age expired. 
     - However, some browsers include a preloaded list of websites using this header.
  - Prevents SSL-stripping (man-in-the-middle attacks that convert request from https to http).
  - can add manually with about:net-internals#hsts (Chrome)

PADDED flag on HEADERS|DATA|PUSH_PROMISE (HTTP/2):
  - adds null-padding at end and padding length at beginning
  - used for security
