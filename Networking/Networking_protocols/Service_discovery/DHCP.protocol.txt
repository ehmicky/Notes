GOAL ==>                      #Distribute IP to a network.
                              #Client-server: give task of distributing private IPs, instead of doing it manually
                              #Can be for private network, or public (ISP)
                              #Allocation strategy can be:
                              #  - dynamic: limited time grant (need to request from time to time)
                              #  - automatic: keeps client<->IP tables to try to give consistent IPs to same clients
                              #  - static: assign IP according to MAC address
