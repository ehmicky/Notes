FEATURES ==>                      #Internet layer, i.e. add features for:
                                  #  - routing (IP address)
                                  #  - congestion (ECN)
                                  #  - anti-loops (TTL)
                                  #  - error correction, for header only
                                  #  - fragmentation

IPv4 PACKET ==>                   #In bytes.
                                  #Start is header, folowed by contents.

                                  #4-7 (IHL, Internet Header Length):
                                  #  - header size, divided by 4
                                  #  - 5 if no Options, up to 15 if max Options
                                  #8-13 (DSCP, Differentiated Services Code Point): used in VoIP
                                  #14-15 (ECN)
                                  #16-31 (Total length): header + contents size (max 65KB)

ECN ==>                           #Explicit Congestion Number. Can be:
                                  #  - 3: incoming congestion, i.e. suggests other end to send fewer packets
                                  #  - 1|2: no congestion
                                  #  - 0: not supported

MTU ==>                           #Maximum Transmission Unit. Max size of a network packet allowed on a given network.
                                  #High MTU:
                                  #  - more latency, due to waiting for data
                                  #  - higher cost of packet corruption
                                  #Low MTU:
                                  #  - more bandwidth, due to more packet headers
                                  #  - more processing, due to more packets
                                  #IPv4 mandates min 160 bytes
MTU DISCOVERY ==>                 #Guess MTU by sending packets with Don't Fragment field, and retrying with smaller sizes
IP FRAGMENTATION ==>              #When link layer has smaller MTU than IP layer, split IP packet.
                                  #Each split packet has same Identification header field
                                  #Can setup Flags header field:
                                  #  - Don't Fragment: drop packet if fragmentation needed
                                  #  - More Fragments: means there are other fragmented packets. Not set on last one.
                                  #Each packet sets its offset, i.e. position where its chunk starts.
                                  #  - max 8191
                                  #  - divided by 8, i.e. max 65KB
                                  #Total length field is of each fragment
                                  #Only with IPv4
                                  #  - IPv6 requires MTU discovery instead

TTL ==>                           #Time To Live.
                                  #Each node decrements by 1. If 0, drop.
                                  #Goal: prevent looping
                                  #Recommended: 64

PROTOCOL NUMBER ==>               #Transport layer protocol
                                  #1 (ICMP), 6 (TCP), 17 (UDP), 58 (IPv6-ICMP), 132 (SCTP)

HEADER CHECKSUM ==>               #Drop if mismatched checksum.
                                  #Recalculated each time due to TTL.
                                  #How:
                                  #  - sums each 2-byte word NUM of the header (except checkum itself)
                                  #  - repeat on the result, since it is likely to be 3 byte long
                                  #Only with IPv4

IP ADDRESS ==>                    #Host ID

                                  #Notation:
                                  #  - XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX (hex, 0000-ffff, 16 bytes)
                                  #  - last XXXX:XXXX can be written X.X.X.X (decimal, 0-255)
                                  #  - can omit XXXX if 0
                                  #  - sometimes surrounded by []

IP ADDRESS STRUCTURE ==>          #First bits (network prefix): network, i.e. group of hosts

                                  #Notation for NUM of bits for the network prefix ("netmask length")
SUBNET MASK ==>                   #Other notation:
                                  #  - 1 bits for network prefix
                                  #  - 0 bits for host identifier
                                  #Also called "network mask"/"netmask"
                                  #E.g. IP/24 -> 255.0.0.0
HOST MASK ==>                     #Complement of subnet mask, e.g. IP/24 -> 0.255.255.255
                                  #Also called "cisco wildcard"
CLASSES ==>                       #Other notation, using the first byte (network number) of IP address.
                                  #Obsolete. Opposite is "classless IP".
                                  #Can be:
                                  #  - 0-127 (class A): IP/8
                                  #  - 128-191 (class B): IP/16
                                  #  - 192-223 (class C): IP/24
                                  #  - 224-239 (class D): IP/4
                                  #  - 240-255 (class E): IP/3

CIDR BLOCK ==>                    #Range of IP addresses for a given network prefix

SUBNET ==>                        #Divising a network into multiple subnets by assigning multiple subnet masks:
                                  #  - a larger one for the network
                                  #  - a smaller one for the subnets
                                  #     - prefixed by the larger one
                                  #     - i.e. network ID is supernet ID + subnet ID
SUPERNET ==>                      #Opposite. Merge multiple networks into a supernet by adding a larger subnet mask
COMMON SUBNETS ==>                #The internet forms a series of subnets:
                                  #  - /0: entire internet
