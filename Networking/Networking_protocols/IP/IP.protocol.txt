ECN ==>                           #Explicit Congestion Number. Can be:
                                  #  - 3: incoming congestion, i.e. suggests other end to send fewer packets
                                  #  - 1|2: no congestion
                                  #  - 0: not supported

MTU ==>                           #Maximum Transmission Unit. Max size of a network packet allowed on a given network.
                                  #High MTU:
                                  #  - more latency, due to waiting for data
                                  #  - higher cost of packet corruption

                                  #  - More Fragments: means there are other fragmented packets. Not set on last one.
                                  #Each packet sets its offset, i.e. position where its chunk starts.

                                  #  - IPv6 requires MTU discovery instead

TTL ==>                           #Time To Live.
                                  #Each node decrements by 1. If 0, drop.
                                  #Goal: prevent looping

                                  #How:
                                  #  - sums each 2-byte word NUM of the header (except checkum itself)
                                  #  - repeat on the result, since it is likely to be 3 byte long

                                  #  - last XXXX:XXXX can be written X.X.X.X (decimal, 0-255)
                                  #  - san omit XXXX if 0

                                  #Not part of the IP address itself.
IP/NUM                            #CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). Notation for network mask.
SUBNET MASK ==>                   #Other notation for network mask.

                                  #     - prefixed by the larger one
                                  #     - i.e. network ID is supernet ID + subnet ID
SUPERNET ==>                      #Opposite. Merge multiple networks into a supernet by adding a larger subnet mask
COMMON SUBNETS ==>                #The internet forms a series of subnets:
